"I was skeptical, but the ingredients all have published scientific studies backing them so I figured for roughly $3.00 per hangover, I’ll give it a try. (I would pay $300 to get rid of some of my hangovers). Drank heavily, took 3 caps at night before bed. Usually wake up with heart palpitations, nausea, sweating, headache etc. used twice so far and I have only woken up tired. You definitely still feel like you drank, but this is the absolute only product I’ve tried that has quelled the symptoms of a hangover. A must have, from someone in the medical field. *Not Medical advice",You definitely still feel like you drank,324 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I hesitated to actually leave a review for this product, as my public and very actual name is here for all to see. I wouldn’t want anyone to think I’m a secret boozehound and nursing a daily hangover. I felt compelled to review this product,however, after seeing the very few negative reviews (especially the one that has the nerve to site other sites/products) since i know how important reviews are to me on this site. I like to have a drink or two at night on occasion. I eat the majority of my food in the day, and I am slight in stature-so this occasionally causes me to wake up feeling “soggy”, not hungover, but not feeling great or even good. I saw an ad for this product on instagram of all things, and after reading reviews here, I ordered a bottle. Ive had it for close to a week, i drank 2 nights out of that week and both nights i took thrive before bed and the results are truly undeniable. I didnt feel slightly nauseous, i didnt feel kind of headachy, i felt great. I have already recommended this to a few friends and am DEFINITELY going to order again when i am down to a few doses. This is a great product.",I dont plan to ever be without this again if i can help it.,544 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased this product a bit reluctantly as it was recommended by a coworker who swears by it. I’ve tried these alocohol recovery products in the past (AKA charcoal tablets) as I can drink with the best of them but my recovery time can only be described or compared to waiting at the DMV or on hold with the post office trying to recover a lost package. Now, the reason I bought this was for a recent bachelor party to Las Vegas that I knew would be full of booze and shenanigans...The first night out that I took it was a fairly mild drinking night. We started with a few beers and eventually a few bottles of Jameson. Now, this product is great, but when you’re 38, out of shape, and don’t party much anymore this was an apocalyptic amount of consumption. I felt the ginger root kick in about the time I was hanging over the rail vomiting into the Belagio Fountains.. shortly after this I felt the vitamins B, C, and E kick in about the time we were running down the strip trying to outrun a a lovely fellow and his 2 female employees who apparently wanted us to pay for the taxi ride from a club (Not a stripper club Mom.) They May have been his sisters) He was certainly concerned with the gap wage everyone’s been talking about lately, by the time we made it back to the Hardrock I felt like a million bucks!  Well, $999,945.00 as I had run smooth out of one of my leather slippers! Needless to say, a short nap and we were ready to hit the pool the next morning which conveniently enough was called Rehab.

"I am a healthy female that normally does not have issues with health supplements. However I heard about this product on Instagram from a follower. I purchased and started taking 1-2 capsules at night after 1-2 cocktails. I noticed after a week I had blood in my stool.. I racked my head to figure out what this could be from.... (I have medical schooling background so very familiar with the human body ) NOTHING in my diet has changed, nothing in my (potty breaks) has changed, Nothing new besides this product.. Soooo I stopped taking it to see if that was the true case and It was! I have been off of it for 4 days and I am back to normal... Please be careful with taking this product. Pay close attention to your body and how it reacts if taking this supplement!!!!",BAD REACTION !!!!,125 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"This is serious magic. Literally Gandalf made these pills so I can drink and be merry even the next day. I can honestly say I haven't had a hangover since taking these pills. I would say I am a medium drinker (Thurs - Sat) beer and wine and when taking Cheers, It's like my mind is confused that my body doesn't feel like doggie doo.In fact just the opposite. I have already got my neighbors hooked on it as it is a must have if you like to imbibe :)oh and if you want a super combo: 2 Advil, 3 Cheers, 2 Glasses of water before bed = Next Day Hero",It's Actual Magic,159 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Did not work one bit.  I had 3 glasses of wine early in the evening (which is a lot for me) took 3 Thrive capsules within an hour and went to bed early.  Next morning I felt just as I do any other time I drink wine:  headache, slightly upset stomach, and foggy.  I was encouraged by all of the positive reviews but now I wonder if they were actual public reviews.  The manufacturer must be laughing at people like me all the way to the bank!  The only way to avoid the effect of alcohol is to avoid alcohol otherwise you need to suck it up and deal with the headache.",Doesn’t Work!

"I have tried many alcohol support supplements and this one is a complete waste of money. It does not work and although the packaging is fancy and I had high hopes since the company was  on SharkTank, the product is garbage. I have used Drinkwel, tried my own  mix of vitamins and minerals, and even used  Emergen-C, and everything else works much better(but Drinkwel  is the best I have found, and no I do not work for that company).. I am convinced that the label with vitamin concentrations is not truthful as other supplement  state similar ingredients and they actually do work and cause my urine to be neon, which this product did not. Do not bother with this product. I wish it worked but it appears they spend more money of the packaging than the actual vitamin.",Do not waste your money,88 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I definitely think these work. I'm less frequently hungover, even if only sleeping better so I'm less groggy the next day. The amount of alcohol I drink and food/water intake still matter, but I was getting hungover even despite trying to hydrate and not overdrink (oh how I hate aging), so this makes me less anxious about having more than 2 or 3 drinks. My main issue is how few pills are in the bottle. There is a lot of empty space, and it only has 30 pills. If you take 3 as a serving, that's only 10 servings, which runs out super fast. At least offer these in bulk??",they work but I wish more came in a bottle,135 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars
The morning after a night out with my friends I was feeling miserable and this product popped up on my feed. I thought what’s the worst that could happen if I bought it? Maybe it’d work and I’d feel better or maybe it wouldn’t. Well boy was that the best $30 I ever spent. I used it for the first time this past weekend and woke up feeling better than I ever had. I was a little groggy at first but within the hour it felt as if I hadn’t even drank. This is by far the best product I have used when it comes to hangovers and it’s not even close. I would highly recommend this to anyone who’s looking to feel brand new after a night of drinking!,Unbelievable results!,91 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"i gotta give it the credit it deserves, this stuff will be a game changer for many people, particularly for things like karaoke nights, bachelor(ette) parties, Vegas trips, etc.! here's my quick thoughts:does it entirely cure a hangover? no.does it make you feel SIGNIFICANTLY better after a night of drinking than you would have if you had just had water and aspirin? absolutely.in my limited experience with this, the only real con is that it's a bit expensive at $30/bottle, especially if you take 3 caplets each time like they recommend. BUT, if you think about it as the per usage cost, i think most people would gladly pay $3 to not feel completely miserable after a long night of drinking.some personal observations:- i've taken this with very little water at the end of the night and yet it somehow manages to assist in preventing miserable headaches that usually occur without proper hydration. this is a giant plus, and means you don't have to rely on any over-the-counter pain relievers i know many people don't like taking, particularly given the warnings that accompany most when it comes to alcohol consumption, etc.- i haven't had an insane night (i really don't like getting wasted to begin with), but on a night of say 4-5 drinks, ive taken just 1 or 2 caplets and it seemed to be just fine. i mention this because i think you can probably ration your bottles depending on your night. having a tough time staying upright? you should prob take 3. just had a martini or 2 with a coworker and usually feel off the next morning? just try 1 caplet and if it doesn't work, try 2 next time.- not sure if any of the vitamins/ingredients would impact this, but i found that i also slept extremely well, even if not a lot of hours, which is sort of amazing.- expiration dates seem to be a little under a year, so don't buy too many in bulk. perhaps the effectiveness is the same and it's just an FDA guideline or something (?) but worth noting if you are religious about shelf life dates.overall, you may not need to use this very often, but its well worth the $30 to have a bottle for those times you maybe stretched your liver's tolerance and only allowed yourself 5 hours of sleep. highly recommend it.",absolutely worth the price of admission! these things work!,36 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I first tried a free sample of Cheers through a Facebook ad, and was automatically enrolled in their auto ship program. I typically don’t like these practices from companies. But the free sample REALLY worked! And in between the free sample and my next delivery, we traveled to see some friends so I ordered more through Amazon to get it quicker. Let me first say that this stuff really does work. I woke up the next day with no headache, no pain in my eyes, a little tired but not hopelessly tired. I also didn’t have the “wake up at 3am from drinking too much” episode. Absolutely no nausea either. And most importantly I didn’t have the day-after-partying blues. I do want to mention that just one pill before bed worked just fine for me. My husband tried anywhere from one pill, to the suggested 3 over the course of our week long vacation and found absolutely no difference between using one, two or three pills.",Will change your day-after-party mood,61 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I’m not a big drinker, but I definitely get killer hangovers. After a night of margarita drinking, I took these pills before going to bed.

Alcohol always gave me a migraine headache the next day.  I tried a wine sulfate filter that helped although I would still wake the next day with a groggy feeling and slight headache.  But there wasn't anything for cocktails.  My daughter-in-law gave me two Thrive+ capsules at a family wedding after I had a glass of champagne and a cocktail at the reception.  It worked!  I awoke the next morning feeling great.  No headache.  No sluggishness.  No groggy feeling.  I was astounded that after all of these years I can have a drink and not suffer the next day.

This stuff is amazing!  It makes the day after 1-2 too many cocktails/glasses of wine SO much more tolerable. It’s not going to save you if you’ve downed a bottle of jack Daniels (you’re screwed not matter what) but if you’ve had 1 too many you won’t even notice it the next day. Much more effective than the standard ibuprofen + water combination.,Perfect solution to a couple too many glasses of wine,172 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Cheers is awesome for responsible drinkers. If you’ve downed a bottle of tequila on an empty stomach and don’t want to pay the consequences, then I’m sorry. This product is not for you. But if you have a bottle of wine over dinner and know you need to bring your A game the next day, ORDER CHEERS RIGHT NOW. I find after I take Cheers, I’m able to wake up on time and think clearly which is super important for pretty much anyone with a job. The all around quality is exceptional. They have a citrus tab so the flavor is refreshing and the packaging looks so nice that I can leave the jar on my nightstand. Also, you get a koozie! Not only a fun freebie but a great way to remember to take your cheers before bed! It’s evident in the packaging that this team truly believes in their product, further emphasized by the handwritten thank you card that explicitly states their guarantee. I know this doesn’t mean I can be a wino but it at least helps reduce the effects on those nights when I indulge.",Fantastic for work/life balance,72 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"So I had a total of 2 double whiskey sodas and a glass of wine.I wanted to test the product which is why I mixed a bit and asked for doubles.I NEED to know that I'll be alright even in the worst cases. Two doubles and a glass of wine isnt a lot but I know myself and I'll get a headache the next day cause of the tannins. I took three capsules right after my last drink.Not only are they hard to swallow , but they have a bad smell and taste. It's not unbearable and would be ok if the product had worked.I get ugly hangovers but this one was the worst!! I felt depressed, sweaty, disgusting and a bit suicidal, and I had the glory of puking my brains out(I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FEEL THIS BAD).

"Cheers is not the same as the old Thrive (after alcohol aid) formula!  I presumed they were the same until I ordered  them and  compared the ingredients. The ingredients are mostly the same except some of the ingredients have been reduced in dosage dramatically!  Also Cheers has a very strong lemon aroma and flavor which, to me, after drinking, is nauseating.  I’m not saying these don’t work, I’m just saying they don’t work as well as the old formula did.Furthermore,  Reading the reviews, most of the five star reviews were in 2018 while it was still Thrive.",Not the same as old Thrive+ After Alcohol Aid!,12 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars

This is the most amazing hangover cure I have ever tried.  And believe me..

"In my personal experience, this product’s main effect is to completely prevent sleep for 24hrs, increase your heart rate, and ruin your quality of life for days. I tried it twice, and on both occasions, I was quite literally wide awake and wired ALL NIGHT.My first time trying cheers, I took a couple pills before drinking and 3 before bed. It was a moderate night out of about 6 or 7 drinks. I was wide awake in bed until after sunrise, and had one of the worst hangovers I can remember the next day.My second time trying cheers, I took just 2 pills after a peaceful night drinking 2 glasses of wine at home. I was actually quite tired at the time, and convinced myself the first experience must have been caused by something else. After taking Cheers I laid wide awake in bed until 9 or 10am. During that time, finding via Amazon reviews that many others had this experience and worse, I literally made myself throw up in attempt to get this product out of my system. I wouldn’t recommend the experience.I’ve never had a sensitivity to any medication or supplement. I’ve read extensive research on DHM, and used Cheers’ competitor FlyBy for years with great results and without these side effects (they were out of stock). I don’t know what it is exactly, but it seems to me that Cheers is recklessly formulated and may contain a stimulant that is not advertised.

"This stuff is wonderfully enabling. Takes away the harsh bite of the hangover.What it doesn’t do though is kick the withdrawal symptoms, which if you’re a regular drinker you know can sometimes be worse than the hangover. (shakes, arrhythmia, anxiety, cravings etc)I’ve bought at least 5 jars of these and am a regular drinker - after taking the pills frequently (not every night but on nights I drank extra heavy (3 times a week) )  I have stopped taking them because of the adverse side effects I’ve experienced.Difficulty swallowing is the worst. The following day after taking the pills swallowing food was painful. Any other swallowing was difficult as if something was stuck in my throat. This side effect subsided but lasted for at least a week.Another terrifying side effect is short term memory loss. Now, before you try and say ‘wElL yOuRe a DrInKeR tHaT cOMeS wItH tHe tErRiToRy” I’ll tell you - as a regular drinker (for a few years)  - my short term memory loss has not been so damaged as it as been by taking these pills. It is nothing short of terrifying.  The short term memory loss alone has stopped me from taking these - I have a full jar on my night stand -I will not be swallowing any more of these pills - ever.My best advice? - DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN ONE DOSE IN A WEEK.It will buffer your hangover if you’re a weekend drinker but don’t make it a habit of relying on these pills.",Side effects are worse than hang over,4 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars
"If you've ever spent any length of time in Japan and you are a drinker, you have probably are familiar with the little 2 oz. shots of Ukon no Chikara (a tasty little Tumeric drink), that if taken right after the last drink, will absolutely prevent any hangover symptoms.  Ukon would be my choice of product, buying it as an import is quite pricey, so I was definitely up to trying something different.  I ordered the $0 trial from the website first and liked the product enough to add it to my subscribe and save auto-delivery here at Amazon.  You can also get it auto-delivered from the website, but I like that control I have over the shipment schedule through Amazon.  I don't typically drink enough to get sloshed, but I do have 2 glasses of red wine every night (maybe up to 4 on a Friday night.)  My main reason for trying the product is not so much to avoid the after-effects that next morning, but more for liver protection.  After your last drink and before bed, you swallow 3 capsules with a glass of water.  The capsules are quite large (which would be my only negative) and have a hint of mint flavor, which I like.  As I said, my reasons for trying were really more about my liver health, rather than avoiding a hangover, but I do feel better in the morning.

Prior to trying Cheers Hangover Cure, I would have said they're all snake oil or some other kind of con. But I may have to change my tune. Since buying this product, there have been 5-6 separate occasions where I've had enough to drink that I should have felt like death-warmed-over the next day. But I took Cheers Hangover Cure before going to bed, and I felt fine the next morning - each and every time. Once or twice I would have said was a fluke or something.

"Starting in my late twenties, red wine would make me restless and wake many times during sleep. It progressively got worse, starting to happen with other alcoholic beverages. It didn’t matter if it was 1 or 4 drinks, vodka, beer or wine, if I was stressed or not stressed at all. I’d wake up shortly after falling asleep and suffer the whole night with anxious feelings, an inability to fall back asleep and would therefore suffer the next day due to the extremely poor sleep I had gotten. The simple solution would be don’t ever drink, right? Wrong. I love a nice glass of wine with dinner with girlfriends or want to be able to toast with champagne, grab a beer at a game, etc. I enjoy it! I was pleasantly surprised to find that Cheers was the answer! I take 3 before bed and sleep well at night. I feel good in the morning and can enjoy my light to moderate social drinking without suffering the poor sleep! Thank you Cheers.

"I get the worst hangovers and I get them very easily. Sometimes, I'll have 2-3 IPAs and feel terrible the entire next day (while hardly being buzzed the night before). It's been so frustrating, that I had stopped wanting to drink at all. So I've been actively searching for anything that could help just a little bit. I first tried cheers about a year ago.  I was extremely skeptical, as I have tried other hangover remedies with no success. But Cheers has been a lifesaver for me.  I feel 100X better than I used to feel when I wake up after drinking. Even after big celebrations, like weddings, I feel great the next day and can even eat and drink mimosas in the morning-- which is worlds different from laying the fetal position with saltines and gatorade.  I bought a bottle for each of my groomsman for my upcoming wedding. For just a few dollars per outing, this is very much worth it. I've even passed this on to friends and family who agree that it works wonders for them as well.

I took 3-4 capsules before bed and drank a bottle of water each time. I don’t recommend this product at all wish I could return it for my money back.

"I was encouraged by the Shark Tank tag, but it turned out to be a hoax product in the end.  My friend tried it before I did, and it turned her normal one-day hangover into a three-day hangover.  I thought maybe she was just really hungover, or coincidentally sick those days, but I tried it as well.  Made me feverish, had horrible digestion issues, couldn't sleep, felt horrible for two days.  If I'd had more to drink than I did and not taken these dumb pills, I'd have felt better than I did after taking them.  Don't waste your money!",DON'T BE FOOLED!

"When I started taking this product, it caused a lot of cystic acne up on my chin. As I didn't link the product to the problem I continued taking them because they do work for hangovers.... that's why I gave them two stars.  But what I didn't know when I read the ingredients for typical acne culprits is that in some people (probably those prone to acne breakouts I would guess) too much Vitamin B12 can cause acne.  I have a tendency towards hormonal acne which appear usually when I slip up with my diet with milk and soy. When I started taking these I had also gone out to eat and just figured that I must have eaten something incorrectly or something had gotten past my radar. After a week of purging both on my chin and purging my kitchen of anything new I started digging into information online.  Hope this helps anyone else going through the same issue.",Caused Acne Flare Up,no rating,2.0 out of 5 stars
"After I turned 30 I started getting hangovers. As I got older, they got worse to the point where even when, after a night of drinking where I wasn't drunk, I'd get terrible sleep and wake up with a headache. That's just unfair right? You shouldn't have to be hung over after actually practicing moderation!I'm a science-minded individual, and therefore a skeptic. So when I heard about these new hangover preventions I was extremely skeptical, even though they have sciency-sounding reasoning behind them. So do essential oils and accupuncture and all sorts of woo medicine treatments right?But, I don't believe hangover prevention is permanently out of reach, and I realized that when someone did figure it out they'd have those same sciency-sounding marketing materials. And it was cheap enough that I figured if it didn't work (which I thought was almost certain) well, it was just the cost of a couple drinks lost. No big deal.So imagine my surprise the first night I imbibed too much, took Thrive, and woke up feeling normal. I ""experimented"" (a.k.a. got drunk) a few more times, and the same thing. I gave it to friends for peer review, and they replicated my experiments with the same results.This stuff actually works. It does. It's not a miracle cure. If you drink enough, you're still going to feel it. But you'll feel it a lot less. If someone asked you if you'd pay a few bucks to turn that bad hangover into a mild one, or a regular one into nothing, you'd say yes in a heartbeat right? That's basically these pills. For what works out to about the price of a couple cups of coffee, these pills save you hours of pain and suffering. That's a great deal.","I'm as surprised as I was skeptical, but this stuff works.",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Last night I was mixing different kinds of alcohol and had somewhere to be today so I figured it was the perfect time to try these out. When I woke up I felt like I had had too much caffeine. Shakes, pounding heart, couldn’t sit still and cold sweats. Things did not improve from there. A few hours later I was VIOLENTLY ill, vomiting & going to the bathroom and the scary part was I was drinking tons of water for the dry mouth I also had and couldn’t pee. About 13/14 hours after I had taken the pills (I took 3 as directed on bottle) things slowly started improving but I still feel funky and my heart keeps racing every now and then even though I’m just sitting on my couch. Needless to say I didn’t make it to where I wanted to go today, and spent the day wondering if I’d end up in ER.",Made me sick,3 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I have been using Cheers for over a year now, and I feel like I don't want to drink without it. I'm in college, so needless to say, my friends and I can get pretty wild sometimes. But no matter how much I drink, if I take three pills, I feel oddly fine the next morning. There still may be some very slight brain fog or like the echo of a headache, but I'm never anxious, I've never had a terrible headache, or been in a bad mood the next day after drinking. I need to keep these to myself since my friends like it, too. The only feedback I have to give Cheers is to find a way to make the product cheaper-- it could help a lot of people!

"I'll be honest. I thought this was a scam. I came for these after seeing Facebook comments saying they work.They really, really do.If you're a professional drunk like me, you know that B12 can work wonders for hangovers. I figured these were just fancy branded B12 pills. They are absolutely not. While they do contain a lot if B12, they also contain a lot more of other things, including a super secret special Japanese magic natural ingredient from the heavens. I don't know what it is, but it works.Directions says to take 3 before passing the hell out after boozing. I've only taken 2, and let me tell you, it is a world of difference. No artillery headache, no seasick queasiness. The next morning, all I felt was worn out from a night if debauchery. You'll still feel sluggish, but you will not be sick.I've always believed in the hangover trifecta: B12, pedialyte, greasy food. Even still, after a night of serious boozing, I needed a 12 hour recovery period. Cheers has totally supplanted the trifecta and caused an alcoholic power struggle in my liver. I can drink more, better, and not beg for death the next day.I'm just as surprised as you are. There really is a hangover cure.

"Don't let the two star review fool you: these pills work. To me, they smell refreshingly like peppermint and definitely deter a hangover when taken the night before.They lose three stars for three reasons. They have substantially decreased the number of pills per bottle since they were Thrive (and bought by a shark tank investor), they have dramatically increased the price, and they have basically become eco terrorists with their packaging.

"Tried this three times. Once -there was no curing that hangover (2 pills). Second time I didn't drink too much, and took one pill and it was OK. Third time I had just the right number of drinks that I thought, three will do the trick (recommended dosage). The next morning I had amazing dreams and woke up with an overwhelming sense of happiness and well being. It seemed to be a mood enhancer. I think that was due to the milk thistle. It really effected me, the last thing on my mind was a hangover. However, milk thistle can have side effects and unfortunately the next next morning I had terrible gastrointestinal issues coupled with a nightmare psychosomatic deja vu fog. (I did not drink the next day.) Diarrhea and nausea, no vomiting or headache. It was like the milk thistle was treating me to a second term of mood alteration via my colon, but in the nightmare direction. That lasted about 2.5 hours and then I had to sleep through the morning until noon. When I woke up I was tired but fine. I don't think milk thistle agrees with me.","Mixed results, has side effects",One person found this helpful,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I was skeptical going in.  But for those nights that get a little out of hand, Cheers really comes in handy.  Does it completely eliminate any semblance of a hangover?  No.  But does it make you more functional?  Yes.  We joke that it takes you from an F to about a B-.  It's not a get-out-of-jail-free solution, but it's something.  Unfortunately, it appears to work for some and not others -- friends have tried it and reported no change, others have seen it erase their hangover entirely.  But to be clear - this has been reserved for those really bad nights.  Those weddings, those New Years parties, those Bachelor/ette parties, where it really will have the biggest impact.  One downfall - you have to take 3 pills per dose, and you have to take them before you go to bed.  Both can be challenging in those...challenging situations.  But I would recommend giving the product a shot, because even if it provides some benefit, it's certainly worth it.",It works for me...but temper expectations,One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this several times when it was called Thrive+ and it worked well when I was drinking regularly (2-3 times a week) and wanted to avoid hangover symptoms. (I also tried other hangover cures then that did not work nearly as well.) Then I stopped drinking completely for a while to get healthy and lose some weight. Once I got that in check, I wanted to be able to have a couple drinks with friends every once in a while but the next day I'd be so depressed and anxious, it just wasn't worth the fun. This product fixes that, too. Now I can go out, have a couple drinks and take this before bed and wake up feeling fine, no extreme moods to deal with and very little other after effects from the booze (you'll still be a bit off, but so minor, it's pretty amazing). I'm a big believer in the science behind this, now having tested it on myself in two different types of drinking scenarios. I'm glad to be able to drink socially and not worry about the next day being super emotional (or queasy). And they send a cute beer coozie with your order.

I find that if I take it before I go to bed, or after my last drink of the evening - I do not feel hungover and foggy the next day. It worked so well the first time I purchased it that I have purchased it again.  Its a bonus knowing its also good for my liver which probably needs the added boost after having a few drinks.

On Sat night, I drank one beer, 2 glasses of wine, and 2 gin cocktails then took these pills (3) before bed. I woke up at 6:30 am feeling fine and went to a spin class. That normally would've resulted in an awful headache and skipping of morning spin class while I ate a bacon, egg, and cheese on the couch.

"I was informed about Cheers (after alcohol aid) by a surgical assistant. She told me how great it worked. I was skeptical because I get THE WORST hangovers even if I only drink a couple alcoholic drinks. I had given up alcohol for 3 years because of that, and I missed the little buzz of happiness. I tried Cheers. I took the capsules right after my last drink of the evening. When I woke up the next day, I felt GREAT! Not one sign of a hangover!

I used to love this product... I have bought about 6 bottles of it. They have changed the packaging and something else. It used to say take 1 to 3 capsules. Now it just says 3. The potency has changed so you have to buy more of it. It used to be taste free. My last bottle tasted like citrus and this new one is mint. They should have stuck to the original that actually worked.I used to speak so highly about this product to everyone. Now I’m a bit embarrassed. I’m not sure what changed but the price seems to keep increasing and the effects are decreasing. Every bottle I’ve ordered has been different. Which is a bit concerning.

"This product did have a positive effect when I drank. But did not completely make the effects of alcohol dissapear. The effects of the supplement seems inconsistent at times, but it's probably due to physiology. It could also be that alcoholic drinks can differ chemically from one another and change the effectiveness of the product. This supplement works really well for me when I drink beer, but definitely doesn't work as well when I drink champagne.

"I absolutely love this product. I have tried another company previously but it was out of stock so I figured I would try Cheers for a family vacation that was going to involve massive amounts of drinking. I bought enough for all of us to try it three times and every morning all of us were completely shocked at how “okay” we were. Now none of us blacked out so I can’t speak to that type of hangover but I can say we all got bombed and we’re up, moving, eating, and ready to start the day by 8-9am which is typically when we would roll out of bed praying for sweet relief or death. Not only will I be buying Cheers again but my three family members who tried it with me will be too. You’re not 100% but it’s definitely as advertised and you’re more than 50% better.

"These work well as long as you don't get blackout wrecked. And they won't completely get rid of your hangover but there is a noticeable decrease in headache severity if you take these compared to taking nothing or Advil only. Make sure to take at least three capsules along with two Advil before going to bed (taking them in the morning doesn't work) and you'll be ready for those bottomless mimosas at brunch the next day. The main knock on these and why I gave four stars instead of five is that they're expensive and don't last long when you drink as much as I do. A little reduction in price would go a long way.

"It all boils down to dihydromyricetin (DHM), a liver detox and hangover prevention ingredient. Most hangover cures are a bit vague as to the amount of DHM they possess. The average product carries 300 mg. Hang Zero, one of the better brands, has 400 mg per serving.... Cheers has 1200 mg, which is the highest on the market!As a seasoned drinker, I've tried many hangover cures and Cheers is by far the most effective. (The worst are those awful drinks, a la DRINKADE, which taste so bad, you'd almost rather just suffer through the hangover!!) For me, Cheers is key to enormously reducing nausea, the sweats, and the runs.I will say, Cheers is much more effective, the smarter you are about hydrating throughout your evening. It's not going to feel like the miracle it *can* be, if you go completely nuts and drink half a bottle of tequila on an empty stomach with no dinner or water, as I did on my birthday. But if you're smarter about your use of Cheers, and add some food/water to your evening drinks, I guarantee you will feel a million times better in the morning. It's a game changer. Absolutely.

"I've been using these pills since I saw the product on Shark Tank earlier this year. The best thing about these pills that makes them stand out to me is that you take them AFTER a night of drinking rather than before. No one ever plans to drink too much, but when you have a night out or a fun bachelor/bachelorette weekend, sometimes you over do it.  They work really well and I highly recommend them. Keep in mind that if you drink WAYYY too much, these pills can only help so much, but even so, they make a HUGE difference.

I was pleasantly surprised. I was able to go about my days with ease. For the record, its no magic pill but the closest thing to it. You still need to drink plenty of water and eat once in a while but once you do that, thrive takes care of the rest. I should mention that I took this with a multivitamin. But before thrive came along, the multivitamin approach did not work out.

My only complaint is when they rebranded and changed the packaging, the amount of powder in the rehydration solution decrease by half; but the price stayed the same. Total bummer.

"I always hated the feeling of waking up after having a few drinks and feeling sluggish... I cancel a work out, take a nap, or just ""get through the day"".... since trying cheers after drinking I have not had to do any of those things I mentioned and the best part is I have no nauseous feeling and don't feel like I need greasy food the next day! I have tried other ""hangover cures"" that you take before bed and it gives me a jittery feeling causing me to feel anxious and not able to get a good night sleep... I have had no such effects from taking cheers... I will say you still need to drink responsibly (I had a night were I got carried away took cheers and woke up feeling MUCH better than I would without taking it but did have the ""get through the day feeling"").

"I went on a 3 day trip where a ton of drinking was involved. I always get bad hangovers so had huge hopes going in with this. First night I only took 2 pills and felt horrible the next morning. Next 2 nights I took 4 pills each night and woke up ok.  In all honesty, I think my old trick of eating a small cucumber and drinking pedialyte before going to sleep worked about the same and was much cheaper.  Thrive was definitely better than doing nothing though.

"Takes about 80% of my hangover away.  I recently went to New Orleans for three days, I took 3 pills every night before bed, along with an aspirin, and felt relatively fine the next day.  Also, I notice I sleep better when I take these.  As you know, by the time you hit your 30s, alcohol plus sleep doesn’t go as smoothly as it did in your 20s.  I also noticed that taking it three days in a row actually made them work better, although I don’t recommend day drinking for three days straight.

Now, I keep in the house and throw it on my bed before I go out drinking so I can remember to take it upon my return.I wake up feeling better than I do while sober and like I’m ready to take on the day. I’ve suggested it to some of my friends in the past and they had less luck but from my anecdotal experience, it works wonderfully.",Cheers saves the day.,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I know what you are thinking, ""$35 for 36 pills, thats almost $1 a pill! thats too expensive""! well, you spend $10 for one drink at the bar.

"So, I’ve used this 4 times now. The first two times I only had a couple of drinks and took one pill. I woke up feeling completely normal, as if I hadn’t had anything to drink the night before. The next time I had had a bit more to drink and took two pills. I had normal energy and a small headache. Lastly, I took 3 pills after a lot of drinks from a holiday party. Usually I wake in the middle of the night, hot & sweaty, with accelerated heart beat and can’t get back to sleep after drinking a similar amount. I did not have these symptoms after Thrive!! I woke up closer to early morning and had a slight headache, but I didn’t not feel that hazy, sluggish feeling at all! This stuff is the real deal!!

"I LOVE this product. It’s made in Houston which is awesome! love the transparency in ingredients.But THEY ACTUALLY WORK! On REALLY rough heavy drinking nights (NYE, BIRTHDAY etc.) to just 2 beers, I take these if I drink alcohol at all. I also make a point to chug a large glass of water when taking them. I will not lie they smell awful but are worth every penny.

"Please don’t misinterpret this as a cure to drinking all you want and thinking you won’t feel anything the next day.  What I did find is that it took less time to recover the next day. I didn’t have a pounding headache and as the day went on I felt more “normal” faster than usual.  I tried on a day where I had about 4-5 drinks, and the next day I felt fine, like i didn’t drink. When you break down the price per serving, it’s definitely worth the money.  The question is, the day after drinking, what would you pay to just feel better? Would it be $10, $20, more? Then this is definitely a bargain.",I’m a believer,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I ordered two bottles...one for me, and one for my daughter who was heading down to South Padre for spring break.  I haven't had an opportunity to use the product yet because I haven't tied one on in the last couple weeks, but she came home from spring break raving about it.  She said she drank heavily every day and never had a hangover while all her friends were hurting bad.  I asked if she offered to share with her friends and she said, ""no way"", so there's a good comparison of someone who took Cheers and someone who didn't.  I'm heading out to a golf trip with 20 guys in a few weeks and I'm certain I'll have an opportunity to use it.  I'll update once I do, but from the perspective of a 22 year old senior in college who was at spring break and drinking heavily, the reviews are very positive.",Tested on 22 year old daughter at spring break,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is a great product to assist in the detoxification of your body from the toxic effects of alcohol.  The few times that I have used it have been pretty impressive.  My favorite attribute is the absence of the horrible headache that can occur after having a wee much alcohol the night before.  No side effects that I have noted.  My husband also thinks this is extremely effective.  Easy breezy use instructions.  Cost is truly the only negative, especially if you take the maximum dose of five capsules which equates to six uses for one bottle.  All in all, a worthy product to keep in the bathroom cabinet.",Helpful for evenings of overindulgence,no rating,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have always been skeptical of hangover cures. Usually I will just try to drink a ton of water and survive the anxiety the next day or do a small workout to try and kick it but I generally get serious hangovers. I saw this on shark tank and a few friends said they believed in it. After a particularly bad wine hangover I ordered a bottle to give it a shot. Honestly it does work and you really can feel it, I think the ""50% better"" claim is very accurate. You won't wake up feeling like you would after a night of no drinks but and you can almost tell that there is a hangover being kept at bay. I have tested this after drinking 4 bottles of white wine and I was significantly better feeling and less anxious. I already ordered a second bottle but this is the first hangover helper that I have ever written a review for and it is a game changer.","Honestly works, Have tested this very heavily!",no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am the type that is very skeptical about these sorts of things and even laughed at myself when I ordered this to give it a try. There does appear to be real science behind the product though so I decided to give it a try. I have used it twice now and I have definitely felt a difference vs not using. I feel the biggest benefit is an overall feeling of well being vs hangovers usually being a depressive event for me. I haven't woken up with a headache, but there was still a bit of nausea. Like many of the other reviews say it does not completely eliminate symptoms just reduces them. I would have been more skeptical if it promised 100% no symptoms. I would recommend giving it a try. I figure if I am willing to go out and pay $8 a beer for a night out I can pay $4 to make the next day more happy and productive.",Definitely helps with the hangover next morning,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am a licensed medical practitioner so I was skeptical about this product at first. I can get pretty bad hangovers that include vomiting and dry heaving all day.  I usually take ibuprofen and have to drink lots of water before bed and have a Gatorade waiting for me in the morning. I was really impressed with this product and happily surprised it worked for me. I had forgotten to drink water before bed and had no ibuprofen after a night of drinking and I woke up feeling a little tried but no headache or vomiting! Interesting enough, I am a medical provider in the ICU and we treat liver failure patients with N-acetyl cysteine which is listed as an ingredient here.

I decided to give it a try because c’mon... who doesn’t want to alleviate hangovers?! My boyfriend and I each took 3 pills after having several drinks one night and both woke up feeling unusually fantastic. As someone who usually has a headache and feels foggy after drinking, I was super surprised to discover how remarkable I felt the next day (especially as someone who is 100 lbs and had at least 4-5 drinks the night before). We now refer to these as our “Magic Pills” and take them any night we have more than 2-3 drinks. Also the smell and taste are really nice.

I have had liver issues and kidney issues in the past prolly due to drinking (not an alcoholic) so I am very concious of how I feel after drinking and what kind of damage I'm doing to my body. That said I still love tequila and a great Napa red wine. I saw this on Shark Tank and it made sense so I tried a bottle. I think this stuff is amazing. I take 3 pills and a glass of water and wake up refreshed like I never had a drink or several the night before. I have  tried a few nights not taking the pills and compared to how I felt the next morning to when I took the pills and there is a world of difference. So much so I just reordered the bigger bottle. Let's face it. Alcohol is a poison but it really taste good. I periodically take a break just to give my liver a break and prolly still will do that but I think these pills really help the body metabolize the alcohol and the byproducts that can leave you tired and sort of ragged out in the morning.

As I started getting older I noticed that even after just two drinks I wouldn’t feel great the next day.  I was sluggish, foggy and only wanted to nap and eat junk food. So, after seeing a couple ads for Cheers I decided to give it a try. Boy was I surprised. Every time I’ve used it I have felt at least 75% better the next day.

"I've now tried several products I've bought via Instagram and Facebook ads, as well as here on Amazon. Most were liquids that require you to consume before, during, and after alcohol consumption, which is certainly more difficult than this product. I also can't attest to the effectiveness of any of them, hence why I never purchase them a second time.Cheers is great in that you only need to take them when you get home after a night out, but more importantly, I've found them to have positively affect my state of calm the morning after.

"I saw this product on Shark Tank when it was called ""Thrive+"" and was interested in the product.  It was one of those ""well, if it really works, that's AWESOME"" kinda things.  And I was somewhat surprised when the inventor didn't get any funding on the show.  But it was because of the marketing.  The Sharks did not respond to the marketing.  So, he fixed that.  He changed the name, brought in an artist to do some clever and fun drawings, even added a drink cooler for fun.  The product is the same, so I would be giving this a rave review anyway, but I can see how the marketing could make a difference for sales, so I hope that has helped the company.  In short - it really does work!  It's kind of like refreshing your body with vitamins and plant roots just when you go to bed if you've been drinking.  I've used it and have really felt the difference the next day.  Feeling better with less fatigue and a general overall higher level of productivity.  So, I highly recommend CHEERS!

"We were introduced to Cheers Restore by some friends and were amazed at how well they helped navigate the day after some moderate to heavy drinking. We sleep better, feel less groggy, and just generally better when we take these after a night of imbibing.The supplements are sent in some fancy-schmancy packaging, with an explanation included that they are required by Amazon to pack that way. The packaging was very eco-friendly, there was just more if it than you would expect.  I'd hope that Amazon considers relaxing that requirement in favor of less packaging.The pills themselves have a minty smell to them which we've found pleasant.Otherwise they just work as promised!

So I was skeptical after seeing this episode of shark tank and trying some other DHM remedies out there.  I’m 30 years old now and hangovers are really hitting me hard for like 2 or 3 days after.  Just this weekend I tried them for a bachelor party.  Each day I woke up after drinking 8-10 plus drinks feeling considerably better than usual.  I was even mixing which I usually try not to do.  By Monday morning I felt almost back to my normal self and was able to get in the gym in the afternoon (usually it takes me until Tuesday or Wednesday til I can do that).

"My headline kind of sums it up. This is about my 5th order of a bottle of Cheers (formerly 'Thrive') so clearly I'm happy with the results of the product. It only gets  4 stars though because it comes in an over-packaged form which includes a (what I consider cheesy) foam beer cozy. I mean, how many of those do I need?It is an expensive product and I'm not happy about paying for the un-needed extra packaging. There should be an option to order it with minimal packaging. I assume the business model is to try to become a staple need for the target audience and when you buy something over and over you don't want to feel like you're subsidizing the marketing for first time users and adding un-needed materials to our land fills.Otherwise happy with the product and the results.","Repeat customer, seems to help, but packaging is excessive and adds to the cost.",One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars

"This stuff truly works!! I have forever suffered from bad hangovers, anxiety and “booze blues” post drinking. So I would always overthink drinking even before I started. I wanted to give this a shot prior to a trip with my friends and use it then as well. I popped 4 each time I’ve used it. Not only does it remind me to chug some water but also take these before bed. I swear the stuff in this helped with all of it the next day.

"Interesting idea, when you’re hooked up to an IV they inject sodium-glucose to help with rehydration. Cheers brings a product where you can easily enjoy the benefit of helping your body rehydrate and feel better after drinking. I love to safely drink with my friends and family on the weekends and taking Cheers helps me feel better and motivated. I do enjoy this product and will purchase again. My only concern is the packaging being in a glass bottle. I dropped the bottle (I promise not under the influence! Haha) and it shattered. The label kept the bottle intact but there are shards of glass mixed in with the pills. I’ve only used the blue bottle twice and I will not risk it taking any of those, it makes me sad to throw away.

The following day, I felt refreshed and had absolutely no hangover!  During NYE, I was heavily drinking and so I increased the dose and took 4 pills.  The following day, I again felt great and had no hangover symptoms.  There are no cons to this product.  The taste is fine and the capsules aren't too big to swallow.  I highly recommend this product to everyone who drinks!",Love this!,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I can’t believe this actually works. Went out out for a friend’s birthday party and drank several drinks and a few shots.

"Works surprisingly well! I've always had horrific hangovers, but taking Thrive has made all the difference! If I take 3-4 capsules before bed after consuming alcohol I am not only able to sleep through the night (something I've struggled with after drinking alcohol), but I also wake up feeling like I didn't drink the night before!

"Before hearing about Cheers, I used to take pure DHM pills after learning about the DHM research on hangovers. I fell in love with them, because I didn't get the anxiety/feelings of dread the day after drinking pretty hard. It was like a miracle...I switched to Cheers based on the additional things they add to their pills, and I haven't looked back. They work VERY WELL. Also nice that the past few months they've had a minty taste, heh...Unquestionably worth your money if you've ever had a hangover (not just the stomach upset kind, but the anxiety/mental weirdness kind).",Changed my life as a mid-30's male in a big city,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've tried this for a month now and just recently started to really notice the cumulative effects. On nights when I drink, I take a few of these Cheers capsules before bed. I wake a lot easier. My body doesn't feel logey and run-down and I have more energy. Before, on those ""day after"" mornings, I had no desire to eat or do much of anything. I feel that I have a better appetite and a desire to get up and get out and do things. Thanks for a great product.

"This actually can work. I've tried this multiple times and it has either significantly reduced a possible hangover or prevented one altogether. I get hangovers very easily, even from a few drinks so this is a lifesaver. Something of note is this is not a miracle cure. You can't drink seven different types of alcohol in one  evening or day drink into the night and have zero water and expect this to fix you.  My best practice is take three pills at the end of drinking with one full bottle of water. If you think you'll be too drunk to remember to take them (I've been there) leave the bottle on your pillow! I've really liked how this has worked for me.",It really works,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Everyone’s body will respond differently, of course, but I have had the best luck with this product for those “mornings after.”  You’ll still be tired, but you will feel significantly less headache-y or sick if you’ve had one too many the night before.

I shared with my friends and now we’re all hooked! Any time we have an event where we know we’ll probably be getting drunk, we take these pills before bed and viola! No hangovers.

"I’m not sure what these people in the reviews are talking about. If you drink heavily the night before you are going to pay the price with a hangover. There’s no magic pill. However, these are amazing for a moderate drinking night. I have the worst hangovers known to man. Even with not that much alcohol. I had 3 glasses of wine last night. Typically, after that I would be having a horrible next day. I took 3 of these and I have no hangover at all. Yes, I am very tired.

"I have tried multiple different products and this is by far the best on the market. I have bounced around to multiple products because none of them have really worked. But then I found Cheers. There is obviously nothing out there that can completely eliminate a hangover, but this is about as close as it comes. If taken as directed, you will definitely notice the difference in the morning.

No it won’t prevent a hangover 100%, but that’s not what the product is advertising and nothing can do that except not drinking alcohol.

Without Cheer’s my hangovers would be 1000x worse. Dosage varies per person and 4 pills works better for me than the recommended 3 pills. Always have it as soon as possible after your last drink. There’s always a substantial difference in my hangovers when I take cheers vs no cheers. I’ve given it to a few of my friends and they wondered why their hangover was way less than before until they remembered I gave them Cheer’s! Now they’re never drinking without Cheer’s! There’s nothing in the world that’ll make you wake up with zero hangovers so you should not expect this to do the same but it does a tremendous job in lessening it to a great degree which I am satisfied with.

"When I first saw this product advertised, I was hesitant BUT the mention of relief from ""hangover anxiety"" really intrigued me.  I didn't know this was a ""thing"", but I have it- I lie awake after an evening out reliving the evening, unable to relax, with my mind spinning.  Thus no sleep, exhausted the next morning and feeling awful!.

I got the chance to used this one just recently. My hubby and went for a 5 days cruise to the Bahamas and got a cheers package where it’s unlimited drinks.

"I ran a few experiments with my drinking where I would take it and not take it after a night of drinking.  I drink a combination of domestic and craft beers ranging in different ABVs.  I definitely saw a difference in how I felt the next day taking Cheers.  I still had a slight hangover feeling and mild tiredness, but had more energy and didn't feel like my day was going to be a total waste.  I would then have a drinking night later in the week, drinking about the same amount of alcohol and not take Cheers.  I would wake up like I used to, feeling very hung over and just wanting to sleep the day away.

I took it a couple of times and it had no effect whatsoever. It blows my mind that it has so many good reviews. Save your money and buy regular electrolyte powder from any grocery store instead. That at least helps a bit. Or simply drink less ;),Zero effect,no rating,1.0 out of 5 stars
"So, first off: there is no cure for a hangover. So if you are expecting something to negate all negative effects of drinking, we are all still waiting on science to figure that out. That said, this does make a difference to me when I drink. I feel less aches the next morning, and headaches are much less severe. I took these with me on a trip to New York and was able to go out to 3 and still do sightseeing the next day.

I bought this when it first came out as Thrive and it absolutely worked. But ever since they changed to cheers it doesn’t work AT ALL. The pills even taste different.

Taking 3-6 capsules at the end of the night has noticeably improved how well I feel and function the next day.

"Skeptical?  Yes, for sure.  First off, I hate hangovers!  I truly hate them....which I'm guessing nobody out there would admit they like them.  I just know people who would rather drink heavy despite the hang over the next day.  Not me....., I try seriously hard to avoid the hang over.  I do however, enjoy the spirits!  I have taken Thrive+ three times now.  The first two times I took two pills after drinking three glasses of wine on two separate occasions, just before bed.  Three glasses of wine is a lot....especially without eating much both times.  I really felt the wine, but I would not say I was drunk or over the legal limit.  Both mornings I woke up feeling ""normal""!  Seriously!  So much so that it made me wonder what I would have felt like had I not taken the two capsules.  So, last Saturday night, I ended up drinking significantly more alcohol over a longer period of time.  Before going to bed, I took three capsules.  I'm happy to report...I actually woke feeling decent.  I had no headache and overall, totally able to function and carry on like normal.  I was sluggish and I could tell I had drank the night before...but given how much I drank and the way I feel, I will be re-ordering more of this.  Now, I would not be drinking excessive knowing that this pill will help me, because I still hate hangovers, but it is nice knowing that two-three capsules and I can literally feel like 95% myself!  Great job for the time and effort on this....breakthrough.  Is it a cure-all?  No.  Can it help you feel decent the next day?  I honestly would say yes!

"It does seem to work. When I first got it, I used it often and kinda forgot what impact it had. But then after not using it for a while and being back to hangovers, when I used it again on a night where I had a very good idea of the hangover I'd have based on exactly what I'd had, it was significantly diminished. I mean, that I'd had drink for drink (same brand of beer/wine and same amount) between two nights where the only difference was whether I'd taken these pills and they definitely made things better. If you're always drinking different amounts when you go out, then it can be difficult to compare how much it impacts you the next day. Even just different beers can have radically different impacts on your hangover. So, it wasn't until I'd done a drink-for-drink comparison in roughly the same timeframe that I felt like the results were not just placebo or that any positive differences being misattributed to the pills where it could have actually been ""Oh, yeah, I drank 8 beers with 3x the alcohol as the beers I normally drink"" on the night I didn't take the pills.

"As I have gotten older my hangovers have seemed to get progressively worse (and I am not even a big drinker, typically just 1 or 2 drinks).  I have tried other hangover helpers before with mediocre results.  I was listening to a Podcast and a doctor that was on the show mentioned that this is what she used (she said something about the formulation of the ingredients and why they worked but honestly I can't remember what she said - just that it made sense when she said it).  I figured what did I have to lose!  I like that you take them after you have had alcohol (so if you do an impromptu happy hour you can still use them).  I can honestly say that I think they work!  I have used them every time since purchasing them that I have had drinks (and this includes St Patricks Day and going on a birthday cruise - which I admittedly consumed more than I should) and the only time I have had a hangover was the time I forgot to take them before I went to sleep (I woke up several hours later and took them but at that point it was to late).

Both of us agreed that it is amazing! I woke up still feeling a little drunk (but with 5 hour of sleep I expected this). But I wasn’t nauseous or sick at all!

I have done EXTENSIVE research on hangover prevention and cure products ( what can I say I love a good party!). I absolutely have found that the Thrive products work. I have found that the capsules paired with the powdered drink mix in a glass of water before bed  really makes a difference in my day after condition. I’m less sluggish and headache-y and generally feel pretty darn good!  The company is also very responsive to any questions through email or Facebook messages.

On a different occasion I partied all night, drank all night, and forgot to take any. That morning I took 2 and after 30 mins I did start noticing a difference and it sure saved my ass since I had to drive across Texas later. I also didn’t feel swimming that time. Definitely will purchase again. I really love how I don’t have cotton mouth or a hydration feeling. I can function like I went to bed early. It does NOT replace sleep deprivation.

"Update after 10 uses:It does help the effects but it just lessens it 50% to 75%. It seems to take me lonfer to fully feel normal, meaning even 2 days after no alcohol there still seems to be some leftover hangover feeling althoigh very slight. The product is still a good product.Time to test this on myself to see if it actually works.....The results:Let me start this by saying I was very skeptical about this and anyone who knows me well, knows I do not like taking any type of pills except for basic vitamins. My body is also very sensitive to anything that is a supplement/drug.Every since changing my diet to ketogenic, it has done wonders for my health and weight so far but my alcohol tolerance has gone down a lot which is normal.I also made sure I ate food that I know I always get a hangover before I decided to try this experiment. I threw everything I had at it to see if it actually works.They also sell a powder to drink along with it. I didn't buy that. The directions said to take 2 to 4 pills. I took 4.1. I woke up and didn't die (always a bonus).2. Sleep was a little more quality that normal on a night I drank. I slept 7 hours.3. Once I was awake this morning I was unable to go back to sleep easily.4. First thing I noticed was my mouth wasn't very dry like normal, this was very nice.5. I usually have a faster heart rate for almost the whole day and higher blood pressure, all was completely normal. (This was awesome!)6. Zero headache!7. My head felt a little swimmy, nothing very bad.8. My body normally will ache, it feels like a normal day today.9. My cognitive function feels very sharp and alert, right after waking I felt 25% foggy and now (3 hours later) I feel 5% foggy.10. Zero nauseaMy overall opinion is Thrive is amazing. It doesn't completely wipe all of the bad away but it comes very close.",Updated 4/27/18 after 10 uses. Hangovers are almost completly gone! Amazing!,11 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I was skeptical. But these pills just helped me Thrive through St. Patrick's Day. I took 4 pills right before bedtime, through the weekend and noticed a HUGE difference from nearly every St. Patty's day I've had in years. I also spread the wealth with friends after testing this myself last week, which wiped me out (how about a bigger bottle?). Rave reviews from everyone. It's nice to have fun, stay up late, and still function the next day without your stomach ruling all of your decisions. We all got decent sleep (staying up late being a factor) and no headaches. Although there is a slight brain ""fuzziness"" the next day, that the (lack of) sleep schedule may have also effected.

I tend to drink and tried them on a few different occasions - first trying 2, then 3, then 4 - on different nights, and I woke up in the morning very foggy. I suppose I wasn't hungover like I usually would be after similar drinking nights, because I didn't have a raging headache, but the symptoms of my hangovers lasted much longer than usual - specifically the groggy/foggy/blah stomach/body feelings. I tried them on a heavy drinking ""party it up"" night, and a light ""after work drinks"" kind of night and had the same foggy/groggy feeling the next day, albeit for a bit less time on the lighter drinking night.

"Didn’t work at all. Actually made me feel worse. I had 5 drinks over the course of seven hours - at no point during the night was I drunk at all. However it is more than I usually drink and I didn’t get to bed until 2 AM. I took three of these pills before bed and woke up at 6 AM unable to go back to sleep, which never happens to me. Not sure what’s in these to keep me awake, but they definitely disrupted my sleep and I feel like crap today. Pretty bad hangover considering I didn’t drink a lot, and drank plenty of water.

"Had 7 beers, only took two pills. Woke up without an alarm after only 6 hours of sleep. I’m definitely very alert and getting work done, but a little swimmy. Rather than hungover, it almost feels like I’ve had two drinks today. Took a third pill after waking up and felt even better, but kind of felt like I had a third drink!

I woke up feeling FAR less dehydrated and didn’t use any of that powder stuff they’re trying to sell. 2.

"I really wanted this to work!  I'm 29 years old and get insane hangovers, I've tried many different remedies (don't judge me, I'm still in my 20s!). I have only tried this once so far and I don't believe it did anything, or possibly may have left me worse off the next day. As a disclaimer, I definitely went hard day drinking on a boat the day I decided to try the pills and I'm not sure if I drank any water within the 6-8 hours when I was drinking all sorts of alcoholic beverages. I don't know if any ""hangover cure"" could have saved me from the level of dehydration I caused myself during that time.. but I had hope. I went to bed pretty early, drank some water and took 4 pills before bed (getting a good amount of sleep usually saves me the next day). The next day I was dead. I definitely vomited multiple times the next day and wasn't able to function until like 6pm. The day after that I got extremely sick- it seemed like a stomach bug, but no fever. I was out for 2 more days with vomiting, diarrhea and severe stomach cramping. I can't conclude that the illness was related to the pills but I definitely thought it was strange or maybe just something was off with my whole digestive tract. I want to try the pills again on a more controlled occasion like a wine night but I am also kind of afraid of the same stomach reaction..Remedies that work best for me are the small vitamin/electrolyte/caffeine drinks so I'll probably just stick with those for the big nights out.",First trial extremely unsuccessful,2 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars

I read the reviews for Thrive+ and decided to give it a try. Wow. All I can say is wow. It absolutely works. All of the usual hangover symptoms, wooziness, headaches, lethargy, nausea -- gone. Thrive+ does not claim to prevent a hangover entirely, just to lessen its symptoms. Both my wife and I agree that it totally does so. We are amazed by Thrive+ and will be ordering more soon. My only wish/recommendation to the manufacturer is that they offer a higher quantity option, particularly because you are supposed to take 2-4 pills at a time.

"Alright, so I pretty much get the worst hangovers of all time. Hazy-ness, nausea—let's not forget the headaches. I've tried pretty much every product on the market, including patches, to help ease my symptoms in the morning. But nothing has compared to the Thrive+!! For me, the biggest hurdle is remembering to take it before going to bed. But I placed these by my bedside before a night out with coworkers, and I woke up ready to tackle the day. The biggest difference I noticed was how clear my head felt. I followed up with the Oral Rehydration Solution just because I like to hydrate ASAP in the morning, and that midday-hangover NEVER hit.

"For all those enamoured with the fact this is a Shark Tank product, consider that the panel is overall concerned with one thing ... profit. If a company can get millions of people to buy a product at thirty bucks and even if 90 percent of people never buy it again because it didn't work, thats a lot of profit for essentially powdered plant and gel cap. So what happens after 90% of people figure out it doesn't work? You completely rebrand it, change the name and packaging ... this used to be called Thrive ... and hope to get a lot of those same 90% who tried it the first time.Before I get into my results trying Thrive, or Cheers, or whatever this will be called in a year, let me point out that the folks who came up with this product weren't scientists. They are very good at branding (and apparently rebranding). There is an FDA logo on the marketing. You'd think it was approved as a product by the FDA. In actuality, it was produced in a factory which as a location for manufacturing was approved by the FDA. This says nothing about the actual product. The numerous scientific studies are, from a medical standpoint, flawed. Read McGill University's story on this ... small samples, no blind testing/placebo testing, etc.The company is very good at capturing a younger audience with its instagram ads and podcast sponsorships. Younger audiences are more likely to try a new product based on claims alone and more apt to binge drink and search for a cure to the after effects. It seems like the reviews are mixed here on results. Which makes me wonder how much marketing goes into this phenominon.The plant based chemical which is the star of the show in this product has a pretty bad rate of not being broken down by the body before being able to be effective. Meaning though used in alternative Chinese medicine, on its own in these concrntrations, Japanese Raisin Bush should not be effective.A friend of mine bought this and I decided to give it a go, although I would be a bit nervous about taking a product which affects my liver breakdown, in a bad or good way, on a regular basis. I followed the instructions during a night of drinking red wine and a tequilla shot and woke up with the same headache and upset stomach I usually do. No change at all.Sorry but if you are looking for a hangover cure, making two young dudes tons of money by buying a well marketed product which was featured on a tv show about millionares looking for products that will offer a high return on their investment ... probably won't help your headache. The power of marketing is a scary thing. Witchcraft would probably remove a hangover just as effectively, which is to say not at all.",If you believe this works I've got a bridge to sell you,3 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I recently was offered a free (actually $1 for shipping) trial of this product to see if I liked it and if it worked. And, since I'm willing to give (almost) anything at least a try once, I went ahead with it. I drank maybe 6-8 shots worth of whiskey and then took three of these pills before bed.And, I have to tell you, overall I was pretty upset soon after. This product contains huge excesses of Thiamine (Vitamin B12), as do many other supplements. Now, what no one seems to realize when they pack in such huge amounts of Thiamine into products like these is that Thiamine has terrible side effects.I couldn't sleep at all! And normally that much whiskey puts me out pretty quickly. Instead, I was restless, getting hot flashes (I'm a guy), irritable, with a weird heart palpitation, and overall unable to sleep! For like two hours!And when I woke up, I had this awful buzz in my head, on par with a typical migraine. Yes, it's true, many of the usual symptoms of my hangovers were gone. But at what cost? I felt nauseous in a /different/ way the entire day. I had a weirdly different sort of headache instead of the normal hangover one. My heart also was racing the entire day.I cannot say I would recommend this product to a friend, as I think these side effects may be more common than people realize. It would have been easy to chock them up to ""normal hangover stuff,"" but my verdict would be to just avoid drinking to excess in the first place.

I live in Houston, so I received my products the very next day. A few days later I had several drinks and thought it would be a good night to try test these out...honestly didn’t think they would do much. I was wrong! After my last drink I toke the 3 Restore capsules and hit the sack. I typically wake up very early, like 4:30-5:00, but I’d had enough to drink the night before I should have felt a bit hungover at least, and also not necessarily feeling drunk, but kinda...if you get my drift. I felt pretty normal and was pleasantly surprised. I went downstairs to get my water and remembered about the Hydrate powder & Protect capsules. I mixed a scoop of HydrAte with a cold glass of water, then drank it down with the two Protect capsules (these are for liver health by the way). About 15 minutes later I felt even better, bright-eyed and very clear, as if I’d not even had a single beer the night before. These worked for me great.

Well, magic I asked for and magic I got!I took this after a wedding with open-bar, and I was the only one of my friends bouncing around the next day as if no drinking happened the night before. No stomach aches, no fever, dehydration, headache, or any of the usual symptoms. I didn't tell my friends I took this and they were wondering why I was the only one who didn't look or act the slightest bit hungover.I've also tried taking this when it was too late and the effects of a hangover were already there. It eliminated most of them rather quickly and I only felt the occasional symptom every few hours.To me, not losing an entire day of productivity to feeling like crap to make up for a fun night before makes this WELL WORTH IT.",It actually.....

"At first, I was hugely skeptical about this pills. There is so many on the internet that claim to stop hang overs so naturally I wasn't buying these with huge expectations. After a night of drinking at my Bachelorette Party, we all took these to hopefully help our hang overs the next day since we had a million wedding things to do. WOW! These did an amazing job! 4/5 of us almost had no hang over. The 5th still had some hang over symptoms but nothing unbearable. Now I have these stocked in the house for parties or any nights of drinking! Sadly, I am not 21 any more and need all the help I can get to recover the next day! Buy them!

"I should preface this review by saying I first received this through their publicly available trial. When I first tried this, I did not drink too much and it did seem to work. I could not really tell since I did not remotely go overboard.  I then decided it was not meant for me. Well, with all auto renewal subscriptions I forgot and I was charged for a full bottle. With their guarantee, I decided it was worth it to give it a further go. I did have a few times where it was a possibility that I could drink further than before and not have to deal with any major consequences, so I proceeded to do just that. Upon using this product, I woke up feeling about 70% better than I normally would for the first time around. No headache, no stomach issues, and sleep was fine. Upon contingent use, the effects were reproduced again, and again, and again. Eventually I ended up drink around 400 - 500ml of whiskey, and upon taking this I woke up feeling around 50-60% normal. Normally, that would cause me a long lasting stomach age that would give way to vomiting and a headache that would last at least 6 hours. Upon waking I had some slight queasiness and a slight headache as if I had drank 200ml and did not take this. After that experience I am convinced this works, and it works exactly as promised. I can confidently say there is a very strong possibility you will feel 50% better taking this before you sleep or right after your last drink. It is a bit pricey, but even if you drink 2 times per week it does last. I have not purchased another bottle for 1 month, I still can go 4-5 more sessions. The real cost is around $18/mo., so give the trial a go. If you drink every week like I do, this is a must have. I do not know how this works, but I can say it definitely does, and for a supplement that is saying something. If there is one thing to go on here, it's that this does seem to contain peppermint, and does contain ginger. Both have been proven to help alleviate stomach issues, so it at least helps with that.","I was highly skeptical, and I was wrong.",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars

"After using several other products including Party Smart, Morning Recovery, Nuun, Pedialyte, Flyby and Blowfish I can tell you this is the least effective of the bunch. Furthermore, the company inadvertently signed me up to a subscription plan which was not easy to cancel.

It's clear to me this company is spending a ton on marketing an inferior product. My best experience has been with Party Smart, its a simple 1 pill remedy, take it with an Aleve and lots of water and Pedialyte and you'll wake up feeling 75-90%.

"After one dose, I am convinced that this works!!! Now that I am in 36, I cannot drink more than 1-2 glasses of wine without feel bad side effects.

People think these pills are an end all, but forget the dehydration part. another factor is consider your size/weight, 3 pills recommended for an average sized person drinking a moderate amount. if youre taking beers and shots to pound town all night and youre 6'3"" 200lbs, three pills aint gonna cut it. if im going out for a heavy night of drinking my regimen is 3 pills towards the end of the night with pedialyte, then two more right before i knock out. water by bedside throughout the night, wake up feeling 90% better than i would have without cheers.",Coming from a pharmacist..,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars

It smells like chemicals and I don't like it at all. I'm really disappointed with these changes and honestly I don't even want to take the pills because they smell so disgusting. Why did they change a good thing?,Smells like chemicals,no rating,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Dislike price and misleading claims. A study of the ingredients will show tiny amounts of NAC. you can go to a drugstore and buy 600 mg capsules, or Amazon for 900 mg.

The morning after a night out with my friends I was feeling miserable and this product popped up on my feed. I thought what’s the worst that could happen if I bought it? Maybe it’d work and I’d feel better or maybe it wouldn’t. Well boy was that the best $30 I ever spent. I used it for the first time this past weekend and woke up feeling better than I ever had. I was a little groggy at first but within the hour it felt as if I hadn’t even drank. This is by far the best product I have used when it comes to hangovers and it’s not even close. I would highly recommend this to anyone who’s looking to feel brand new after a night of drinking!,Works as advertised!,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have been using Cheers (formerly Thrive) for about a year now.

"Was in Cancun for my buddies' wedding this past week. All-inclusive so basically drinking from breakfast to midnight. He sold pretty high on these Cheers pills so I figured why not? Went ham on the first day and just assumed I was going to be in for a rude awakening in the morning. Took 3 that night and actually woke up feeling fine. Like.. i'm saying not 50% better, not 75% better.. like I didn't drink at all. I was shocked. Ironically days 3-5 varied. I had a pretty bad headache on the third day. Liquid IV and a workout helped even that one out. I woke up feeling pretty decent the fourth day. Like I knew I had drank too much but wasn't all foggy in my head. Last day was a wash because we had an early flight out. Couldn't tell if I was hungover or just super tired. Either way -- I think this is to be expected. It varies on how you will feel based on how many you throwback. In my book - If I'm about to go on a trip with a lot of drinking it totally makes sense to buy these and try them out. Feeling marginally better is a win in my book compared to just feeling crappy. The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. Per serving it was a little steep. Again -- justified since I knew we would be going hard in the paint on this trip -- but there appears to be a couple of cheaper options out there that MAY work as well. As for me, I'll buy these every time. Highly recommended.",I mean... this stuff is pretty good,One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars

"A friend recommended cheers after a night of drinking, he swore by these pills. I did notice the morning of that I felt pretty dam good, especially after mixing liquors the night before (vodka, beer, fireball🤢). Definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to feel lousy in the morning after drinking past their limit.",Works as advertised,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
I was skeptical at first but after a couple of nights out I took these pills and didn't have my normal pounding headaches in the morning.  I wasn't 100% recovered but definitely felt significantly better than I normally do after a night of drinking.  One night I drank 10 beers and then got up the next morning and ran a half marathon.,"Hard to believe, but they work",no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Let’s start off with the actual product, it’s not great at all. They didn’t help at all, I felt the same the next day. I should have listened to other reviews. They also ARE NOT FDA APPROVED. I specifically remembered NOT signing up for auto refills, but somehow they still managed to take money out of my account for it... Honestly just take a few Tylenol and an emergen-C the next morning because it’s basically the same... save yourself the trouble.",Beware,no rating,1.0 out of 5 stars

I have been a long time user of cheers though the most recent time that I ordered the product looked completely different and almost counterfeit. The pills are no longer white with the cheers branding instead I got capsules that suspiciously EXACTLY like the flyby brand. The thing inside that is supposed to keep the pills from going bad is also different it is a bag instead of the usual gel based one. I have requested a refund.,The product being shipped is different,no rating,2.0 out of 5 stars
