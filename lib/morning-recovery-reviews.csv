"So I don't know how this is possible, but not only do these work, but they work better than advertised. I got drunk yesterday, because, you know, Tuesday night, and I popped one of these to see if it works.First impressions: Smells terrible. Taste isn't amazing (and it has a distinct aftertaste that you're going to need to wash down, but you were going to do that anyway), but it's not hugely unpleasant. The next day I got up and realized... huh. I am not at all hung over. As the day went on I realized that I actually feel *better than I would have if I hadn't even gotten drunk last night and it was just a normal day.*I don't know the formulation of magic you're putting into these, but keep doing it. They're too expensive to make them something that anyone could reasonably use every time they drink (unless they're like, not an alcoholic or something crazy like that) but this is definitely a product to keep around for those days when you really want to get drunk but you're taking the BAR exam tomorrow. I'd knock a star off for the smell, but these things are so amazing that they automatically get a bonus star.",Some kind of witchcraft,373 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                   Taste - Winner: PartyAidPartyAid tastes like a sports drink I've had before. Lightly carbonated is also a nice touch. Morning Recovery (w/Sugar), given how small it is, has a really strong concentrated herbal taste. It's kind of like a really warm left our for a day apple juice, but it's not pleasant. But less to drink of it that's of any help. Just type in ""taste"" in customer reviews..If you want something to drink in the morning on the way to work, I'd pick PartyAid just because I know I can't down Morning Recovery when I'm half awake. Although the taste might be a nice wake up call.Portability - Winner: Morning RecoveryBoth are drinks but Morning Recovery is 100ml which is TSA / Airplane friendly. PartyAid is not.Price - Winner: PartyAidMorning Recovery: $119.99 for 24 = $5 a canPartyAid: $59.99 for 24 = $2.50 a canSimple Math here.Science behind drink: TieMorning recovery uses a lot of East Asian Herbs for detox and well being after drinking. If you believe those things are helpful, this drink is for you. PartyAid uses supplements that focus on the neurotransmitters for mental clarity and detox.Morning RecoveryMain ingredients: DHM is from the Japanese Raisen Tree and the main thing is Morning Recovery's patented version is more bio available and absorbs better than cheaper DHM pills available by other brands.Prickly Pear & Korean Pear: Both help the liver metabolize alcohol and protect the liver.Secondary Ingredients: The usual herbs you find elsewhere: Milk Thistle, Ginseng, Green Tea Extract, Electrolytes, Vitamins B/C--PartyAidMain ingredients: L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) & L-Tyrosine - Both help neurotransmitters in the brain with 5-HTP focusing on serotonin and melotonin levels to keep your mood up. L-tyrosine focuses on helping your brain work during fatigue / sleep deprivation. I guess the goal is keeping your ability to think and function after drinking it feels less like a hangover.L-carnitine helps you get an energy boost when fatigued. What you see in some workout supplements.Secondary ingredients: The usual herbs you find elsewhere: Milk Thistle, Ginseng (Eleuthero Root), Zinc, Biotin, Electrolytes, Vitamins A/B/C/EYou pick what you believe works, they both take different approaches but besides the main ingredients are basically the same. No caffeine in either.--How it Works - Winner: TieBoth drinks claim the same kind of effect. And recommend taking one before and one after the night out. One drink before is good for just casual session. You wake up next day feeling good. For a heavier night out of drinking, taking both was interesting. Still kind of woke up with some headache but definitely minimized. Can't put into words but it just feels easier to get up and do your routine vs that lazy feeling of screw it I'm calling out sick.--Conclusion: Both products are similar in term of how they make you feel after drinking. If you prefer something airplane friendly and concentrated with herbs, Morning recovery might be for you.For me, the taste factor (I can't get past Morning recovery's new flavor) and the price being half of Morning Recovery, makes PartyAid my choice.",Which is best?

"I am not the type of person to write reviews on Amazon, but I had to change my ways for this one.Drinking, is unfortunately my vice. I drink at least 3-4 days of the week and this takes a huge toll on my productivity the next day.  I tend to operate at 70% capacity, which quite frankly, has put me in the verge of getting fired for quite some time now. Something HAD to change or I wouldn't have a job for much longer.After an amazing day drinking event followed by an NBA watching party at our favorite brewery, once again, Sunday Scaries hit hard. My Scaries are usually appeased by my second vice, impulsive shopping.Given that my housemate is obsessed with alcohol flush, I decided to buy something for him, because, ""Hey! I may lose my job, but I will still have my friends!"" One thing brought the next, and browsing through related products (most of which I ended buying anyway), I ran into this miracle of a product.Next week comes, and the poor work performance continues. At this point, I am truly running out of options. I either stop drinking, or lose my job. Given that both options could not match/sustain my lifestyle, I decided that this Thirsty Thursday will be DIFFERENT. I frantically searched through my amazon boxes in my closet (which at this point seems more like an amazon warehouse) trying to find the Recovery bottles.These bottles contain the elixir for human life. I woke up the next morning, feeling like I was REBORN. After running a mile, I went in work, and everyone immediately realized something was off. ""You look great today BUDDY!"", ""Your skin is shining whats up with that?"" are only some of the compliments that kept pouring my way. Needless to say I have used it every day since and as a matter of fact. My work performance has finally reached acceptable levels, while I can enjoy my weekdays as I like to.I have talked to all my brajes and brajettes about this miracle of a product, and at this point I am an unofficial sales rep for them. If there is anyone reading this out there, THANK YOU for saving my Thirsty Thursdays and please consider me if any marketing positions open up!Morning Recovery is the hero I needed, but didn't deserve!",Make Thirsty Thursdays Great Again,249 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Definitely work's, exspensive but worth it when you drink heavy liquor and up all night for 3 days in a row. Only thing is, 6 pack will only last you 1 weekend. Fri 2, sat 2, & sun 2. You have to drink 1 before your first drink and again after your last drink for it to actually work. Don't just take 1 after drinking, it doesn't work trust me, I've been using these for 2 months. My 1st and last mistake was only taking 1 after my last drink. No good doesn't work. After that failed morning after, i did the 2 and next morning felt good. I was able to get up and motivated and get things done without that awful hungover feeling!",Great,80 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Long time user of Morning Recovery since version 1. Here’s my feedback.⁃I’m excited for this company. Whatever they’re doing in the lab, it works better and better each time. I get the science. They’ve made it easy to understand (pills vs Morning Recovery)⁃This version works better than version 2. I just feel much clear headed in the morning than the previous version (which was still great and above my expectations). I get my money’s worth for every bottle by having ingredients that actually get absorbed into my body.⁃Do I get crazy and irresponsible with drinking? No - I just get really bad hangovers. Two glasses of wine give me terrible headaches.⁃Taste? It’s not that bad, and perhaps not the best and greatest for everyone. But the product delivers. I’m the type of person that would rather face ugly truths than pretty lies. I’d drink this to know it works for me in the morning than talking about how it tastes.Overall, I’m a satisfied customer and I’ve recommended this product countless times.

"Hands down the best hangover prevention I have sampled - it has me drinking like a college freshman on probation again.Typically after a night of heavy drinking, I tend to binge watching clips of the Olympics to remind myself what energetic people look like. But one serving of this bad boy before I go out, and I don’t have to cancel my plans because I went out the night before.Not only that, but this product has dynamically changed my recovery process. I used to seek shelter in fried food and unholy volumes of soup. But that is in the past - I am no longer at the whims of my sensitive stomach because I can avoid being hungover all together. Trust me when I tell you, the other products don’t hold a candle to this weekend saving elixir.",Magic Elixir,51 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was pretty skeptical but a friend of mine swears by it, so I've tried Morning Recovery many times, and have never felt a bit hungover the night after revelry that concluded with a morning recovery.  As witness to this: imagine you are so tipsy that you think it's hilarious to pose your kitten with a beverage you bought online and in its box.  Well indeed we were once that tipsy, and you can see the results above, and indeed ladies and gentlemen even after a night that was that... silly: no hangover.  And it tastes great so there's really nothing to lose: try it and see if it works for you",works great and tastes great,28 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This was nice because it was already made, and I just popped it in the fridge. I didn't realize until I bought it that you're supposed to drink them all throughout the night while you're consuming alcohol. For the price of these - that is ridiculous. I only drank 1 within 1 hour of stopping drinking and I felt fine the next day; however, I only had 4 beers. I'm not sure how it would work for heavy drinking. It smelled like fruitloops soaking in milk, and it tasted ok. I was aggravated because within the packaging there was a promotional offer that told me to text a number and I would be able to send a free 6 pack of these to a friend. As soon as I texted the number, I got a response saying that the promotion changed to getting people to purchase a 6 pack with $10 off coupon which would allow me to bank $10 off my next purchase. That was really annoying because the promotion card was for a free 6 pack for a friend. I feel that they should be responsible for honoring what was in the packaging. I understand changing the promotion, but at least honor what you have left in terms of packaging. This set me up for something and let me down. From now own I will buy Liquid IV and pedialyte for much less and to serve the same purpose.",Expensive product - pedialyte is cheaper,15 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I cannot emphasize how disappointing this ""so called"" anti-hangover drink was.  I put this item to the test while on a weekend trip to the river. I did my drinking and took Morning Recovery as directed. Hoping to feel like a new man the following day, instead I was feeling like crap for the next two days. To add, I even took an additional Recovery in between my drinks. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.

"I have bought this product many times, and I must say it works.  After sharing it with friends over the last year, they are all in agreement.I recently had some issues with a few changes that have been made, and a More Labs representative immediately reached out to me.Living in a world with many companies that care only about their bottom line, it was refreshing to experience such a high level of customer care.When taking supplements, we need to trust the companies that are providing them.

"The newest version of this is useless, they do NOT work.  I LOVED the old ones...you could totally rely on them and have a GREAT day the next day.  I made the mistake of assuming these would be the same and I was dead the next day, worthless.  I thought maybe I just drank too much even for this so tried it again the next time I went out.  I drank much less the next time and again was incredibly hung over the next day.  I'm super sad.  The last ones were a life changer.  These are junk.  Please bring back the old formula.  I used to buy these for friends and they were always so well received...and USED a lot! I won't be buying anymore of this version. :(","Bring back the old formula, PLEASE",14 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I am someone who knows his way around a hangover, and I've never found any cure or preventative beyond good ol' water, so I was a bit skeptical when I saw the YouTube ad for this witch's brew, especially after reading a few reviews saying it did nothing, and even more so when I read that scientists haven't even nailed down exactly why hangovers happen.So, strictly for the sake of science, I decided to order some and put it through a good, hard test. I poured myself a 13% ABV beer, ordered some Taco Bell on Grubhub, and settled into a movie I no longer remember. You know, the kind of evening that should ruin the following day.Except...it didn't. I still woke up dehydrated, wobbly, and not yet safe to drive a car, but...no headache or nausea. At all. It's the oddest feeling when your brain half expects to throw up, but your body says, ""nope, we're good."" As I'm writing this, I'm still in the middle of what should be a nasty morning of punishment for last night's bender, but instead I feel like I could go run a 5K before breakfast. As one other reviewer said, I might actually feel *better* than if I hadn't drunk anything at all.Hangovers are probably different for everyone, which might explain why the reviews are so divided. But for me, Morning Recovery was a gift from Bacchus. It truly did recover my otherwise lost morning. What does it taste like? Who cares? For an effect like this, I'd drink 100mL of my dog's pee (but it's actually fairly pleasant). Give it a try!","Holy crap, this stuff is miraculous.",10 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I had my hopes up high for this and was let down.  I have tried it three times all three times have failed over a course of two weeks.Try #1 - My first attempt at using Morning Recovery  I don't think anything would have help and I don't blame the product for just me being stupid.  I knew I was going to drink so I chugged a bottle and got my first drink from a brand new 1-liter bottle of Johnnie Walker White Walker.  Stupid me took the bottle with me to my office and started playing dayz.  In less than two hours I drank half a liter of it not even thinking about it!  Mistakes where made, never again.  I don't recall anything that night.  I woke up the next day with an extreme hangover, nausea and a .04 BAC.Try #2 This time I paced myself and I would get a drink wait 20 mins and test my BAC and do it over till I was done, at the end of the night I was a 0.07.  I took the Morning Recovery right after my last glass.  I woke up the next day with a mild hangover and a 0.0 BAC.Try #3 This time I took the Morning Recovery before my first drink and I was drinking mix drinks, Jack and coke, old fashioned and so on.  I was not watching my BAC until the end when I was good and buzzed.  My BAC was 0.08.  Once again I woke up with a mild hangover.I sure it works for other people just not me.  I do not like the flavor of it and I would not buy this again.  I think I am going to throw away the other three bottles",Did not work for me and the taste is not that good but still drinkable.,7 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATE: I haven't had a hangover in years. not an endorsement for binge drinking, but I've learned that if I'm going big a night (say vacation or a wedding or something where I'm having 5 drinks or more in a 12 hrs period), I now just take a second bottle! anyone who this isn't working for, well, I just have to believe they aren't taking it correctly. You need to take it when you drink not the next day, and if you're going large, have another! Works insanely well.original post:I KNOW this is probably for folks who didn't need that extra glass of wine or beer, and need to be sharp in the morning... But I accidentally put it to the test. Full disclosure, I'm a mom who hasn't had more than one beer in a sitting bc of pregnancy and breastfeeding... The last time I had more than two drinks was almost three years ago. So, my dearest friends came to town and my darling hubby watched the babe. I drank 15 drinks (there were shots, tiki drinks, cocktails,wine, beers, you name it-i drank it). The next morning I felt shockingly okay. I walked to breakfast, ralphed (which is my 30s hangover migraine precursor), and NEVER felt poorly. Not at all. Not even a headache. Sure my body wanted to get rid of that much poison, but holy hell, no ramifications of being a bad kid all night.Definitely will use again for any time I want one more drink than I should... But will probably avoid having 13 more than I should 😂",Put it to the test and am a true believer!!!!!!!!!!,8 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ve been trying this supplement for over a year now. My brother buys it an often slips me a bottle after we’ve been out drinking. I’ve always experienced instant nausea feelings and had to burp down and calm down so that I don’t throw up. One incident I actually threw up within twenty minutes of consuming this product. They recently came out with an updated version and I bought the 5 pack. I felt the usual nausea and found myself puking the entire morning afterwards. I never throw up from drinking and this wasn’t even my usual night of drinking. I wouldn’t purchase this product again. If you have a sensitive stomach, this might not be the best remedy for you. I do have other friends who enjoy this product and don’t experience these symptoms but one friend of mine does get the exact same reaction.

"I was a HUGE fan of Morning Recovery’s first version. I used it August 2019 on my honeymoon cruise and felt like it literally saved my life and allowed me to enjoy a week with zero hangovers, even with hard liquor. However, this new formulation is a big fail. The flavor is pretty gross - I think last year I had a peachy flavor? It only comes in lemon now and it’s barely palatable. I’ve used it twice now after just drinking beer. It doesn’t work like it used to. It may have had a small effect but nothing near the way it used to. I’m super bummed because I swore by this product and recommended it to my friends, but I can’t do that any more.",New formulation gets a thumbs down,5 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I love this.  It seriously works. I found our first two bottles at a drug store and thought we would try it for our wedding festivities.  We were floored with how we didn't have hangovers after our bachelor and bachelorette parties.  We bought this bulk package for the wedding itself and handed them to as many people as we could. You need to take it BEFORE the hangover.  Also make sure you pace yourself over the week.  You can't just keep taking them and getting drunk. I did that the honeymoon week and couldn't feel my big toe anymore.  I looked it up and it could have been caused by alcohol poisoning or cutting off circulation for too long.  The feeling came back over a few months, but just notice how much vitamin B is in this.  It's a lot of a kind that messes with your nerves.  It tastes pretty bad, but it's not enough you can't just drink it and get over it.  Chase it with your alcoholic drinks 😉",This stuff is insanely strong,4 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars

Pretty expensive and no beneficial relief after a bottle of wine. I even drank 4 large glasses of juice during the night.

"I saw this at a local drug store while on vacation and figured I'd pick one up. I drink 3-4 days a week. While I've been trying to limit my alcohol intake, some days I just start at lunch and keep going. I'll get a good buzz but not destroyed. I'm self employed so I do not have to worry about work problems. A couple of days ago I started with the crown and diet cokes at noon. One after the other. That evening I drank some water and went to sleep. Middle of the night I went to the bathroom and had that crappy I drank too much feeling. The next morning I woke up and had the lingering feeling of a hang over. I could have pushed through my day but I would not have gotten much done. It was about a 5 out of 10 on hang overs. I remembered I had this bottle in my luggage. The lemon taste reminds me of 5 hour energy. I expected it to taste exactly as it did. There combining so much in a small package. So after taking it I do not think it was 30 minutes later, I was fine. Actually had a great day. I just ordered more. I can say 100 percent it worked for me for a mild hang over and I took it in the morning. I personally will not take it at night because I'm sensitive to some of the ingredients and don't think I can sleep on them. But one in the morning worked great. Now it I go crazy and get plastered, I may consider a night dose as well out of desperation. So I recommend it. I can't speak for a 10 out of 10 hang over.

I am always skeptical when it comes to online reviews, however after using this during my sister‘s 21st birthday and waking up, then getting on a plane for seven hours I felt great! No pain medication or extended bathroom stays needed. Just felt a little tired but that was from lack of sleep. Even my sister who had several alcoholic beverages to say the least, says she didn’t even have a headache after drinking this tea. Be sure and drink it at night before you go to bed.

"Over the course of 6.5 months, I tried 15 bottles of original flavor and 12 bottles of sugar-free. For me, this product only helps a little by itself. However, I was able to get much better results by combining it with additional DHM in capsule form (from Double Wood and sold here on Amazon). Given the relatively high price of Morning Recovery, I wish it included more DHM.

"It's quite amazing really, 3 am on a Friday night. Not really sure how I got to this point but after around 15 IPAs and a action filled night of pizza rolls and rocket league. I knew waking up in 6 hours to go to work probably wasnt my best idea of the week, let alone the day. As I was wondering if I was rolling into bed or if the room was just spinning....I remembered this little blue bottle that made promises to heal all of my  bad choices on days like these. So cracked it open and I have to say the taste is like sucking on a orange peel with kinda the taste of plain black tea.... if black tea was a pile of rotten leaves. Anyhow its not the worst thing I tasted but it was quickly forgotten by the magic this little sucker holds. When I woke up not only did I not feel like i was in a bar fight the night before blocking every punch with my face, i truly felt amazing.

"I've had the opportunity to try out the very first batch of morning recovery and I've gotta say that this company truly impresses me! Their product is not a gimmick and I'd say one of the first, if not the first companies that made this type of drink. If you're an avid drinker then this 6 pack would last you quite a while but if you plan on partying non-stop, the cost of this morning recovery will add up if you're okay with it. If you haven't tried this, I recommend you trying it because you'll get hooked and you won't try anything else because the flavor is impeccable and the bottles are cool!

"I was pretty skeptical because Ive tried several of these types of pre party drinks and hangover preventers before with basically very little success. These I can say are the best I’ve ever tried. Pretty expensive but they work and that the main thing. Recently had started drinking vodkas after lunchtime and kept drinking into the late evening when I received an email invite from my boss to give a presentation the next day at 10am to a massive customer. Needless to say I panicked and immediately downed one of these, stupid drunk had one more drink before going to bed after 1am.

"Tried lots of hangover remedies without any of them ever working on a consistent basis.  Tried this a few times on different occasions and actually worked pretty well and consistently each time.  Tastes pretty good, but I don't try these types of remedies for their taste.  I don't care if it tasted like wet garbage, if it gets the job done, then i'll use it.  And this does get the job done pretty well, so it tasting decent was just a little side bonus.I get pretty terrible hangovers.  i feel lethargic, scatter-brained, and heightened anxiety.  I won't say that this eliminated these symptoms outright, but it did significantly reduce them to the point where i could function like a normal human being.

"Ok so, I guess you could say the hangover was not as bad. But the taste...oh my god the taste. Not sure how they get away with saying it's ""lemon flavored"". If by ""lemon"", they mean ""pureed turkey"", then yes. It tastes like liquid turkey in a bottle. (I would assume its the extremely high vitamin percentages.) It's a miracle that my 3 friends and myself didn't projectile vomit as we were drinking it. Every sip we took, we had to chase it with a bite of a taco.So really...not sure if it was the drink that helped the hangover...or just the tacos helped. *shoulder shrug*I know why they are $5 a bottle when you buy a box of 6. The bottles are glass. So save the bottles and sterilize the melted turkey smell out of them and find a way to reuse them.

"Was definitely a skeptic at first but I’m sold.  Overall, great product!Miss the peach flavor and lemon is terrible imo, but it’s much better than a full blown hangover :).  Tastes better refrigerated, so definitely recommend just keeping them chilled.They are definitely a bit pricy, so I tend to buy them when they’re on sale through lightning deals etc..  If they were cheaper, I’d use them way more often because I find them to be helpful even just as a vitamins and a liver support supplement.  I’d love to see them come down to $2.50 or so a pop, and I’d be more inclined to use them every other day or daily if that were the case.  Would even subscribe if that were to happen :).Although it’s probably just because this contains vitamin B, I find that they make me feel more energized while drinking, and even give me a boost if I’m not.

"I'll start by saying this is the first Amazon review I have ever left, and I am happy to make this drink my first because it has honestly changed my life. Great for hydration and especially great if I drink a lot of alcohol.A friend of mine gave me a Morning Recovery after having drank heavily following the Patriots loss to the Dolphins a few days before New Years. The next day we woke up early and went skiing and I did not understand why I felt so good. We skid for the entire day and I never felt like I had just drank 10 drinks the night before and was up until 2 am.A few days later I was with the same friend over New Years and we were up late again. We drank beer, wine, shots , and cocktails well into the New Year and right before bed I took a Morning Recovery. In the morning it was the same things. I had one of the best full sleeps and woke up feeling great and went back up to the mountain to have another day of skiing.When I got home I ordered the 24 pack and I am now religious about drinking a Morning Labs if I drink.

I haven't tried everything -- but vitamin water XXX and those little vitamin packets they sell at 7-11 just don't cut it.

Even on those unfortunate mornings when I had a plane to catch before I was done sleeping it off (ie waking up buzzed) I still felt significantly less nauseated and zapped out than was the usual.

This drink/product really works! I brought a 6 pack to a weekend music festival as I knew it was going to be long hours and lots of drinks.

This really works. It's not a miracle but you will feel 50%. It is enough that you will absolutely notice you feel better the next day.

"There are way too many DHM products out there that work and do not work. Or people thinking that it works. Morning Recovery solved hangovers. Period. I've tried a number of solutions and after coming across this one literally can’t wake up without it.In my experience with many so-called “hangover pills”, I could never say it worked for sure. This brand explains hangovers in easy science. Your stomach basically can’t absorb DHM like other supplements. You’re really peeing it out. Instead, they figured out how to dissolve into a drink so that you’re effectively absorbing the central ingredient. Not a big fan of the taste, but it’s fine IMHO.

"The flavor is not wonderful. Not at all. But the product itself is.  I turned 30 yesterday, hangovers are already hard for me.... but alas, I decided to get a little wild. 4 margaritas, 1/2 bottle of straight tequila, 2 rum drinks, some moonshine pickles and a bloody Mary later... I was 3 sheets to the wind. For some background, I don't drink, haven't in yearsssss, and on the rare occasion I have 1-2 mixed drinks/beer/glases of wine, I'm sleeping for 12 hours and pounding back ibuprofen and pedialyte for the next day or two. A wonderful friend of mine had left one of these and a bottle of water on my table for me to drink before bed. I was up at 8am this morning bright eyed and bushy tailed. I will NEVER drink without this in my arsenal again. She purchased them somewhere else, but I'm already on Amazon trying to order them in bulk, and figured I would leave a review. 🤣🤣","If you're old enough to know what time Usher was cruising the streets, you need this.",One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATED 11/19/2020:I've downgraded to 1 stars because although I believe the proprietary ingredients are science-based, they are misleading customers, including me, and have an inaccurate ingredient listing on Amazon AS WELL AS THEIR OWN MORELABS.com website. Dispicable. On their website and Amazon, the ""New and Improved Original Lemon Morning Recovery"" does not list that it has a FAKE SWEETENER and a BAD ONE - SUCRALOSE. The bottle has it listed as last ingredient. Their website claims 55 calories, the actual bottle has 50 calories. Their website claims on the ingredient list ""Natural Lemon Flavor"" and the actual bottle states ""Natural Flavor"" - either way, it's NOT REAL LEMON, and companies can state ""Natural"" even when it's synthetic. They also add Green tea extract, which means it contains caffeine, which means it's not beneficial before bed for a lot of people, myself included. Nowhere does it state how much caffeine which doesn't help, and they could do decaf green if they cared to. I'm extremely disappointed as I believe they have created a great product, but with the false addition of Sucralose, I will be returning this product and am extremely displeased with them as a company to mislead customers and to add an ingredient without making customers aware. BUYER BEWARE.Previous review:I do believe Morning Recovery worked for me, or helped me recover better in am after now trying it 4 times. I'd only really over-indulged one of those times and other times had 2-4 drinks over course of the evening. Though it's always hard to say if a product truly worked when you can't do the opposite experiment and not take it, I do believe there was a noticeable difference in the am after taking it. I've also researched ""anti-hangover"" supplements a great deal and have tried others before, so I'm glad to recognize some of the quality ingredients in Morning Recovery. The taste is fine, it's medicinal but palatable and I like that you can put in the fridge and just take it quickly, not have to make a drink or swallow a few pills. I do recommend it, am writing my review freely w/o compensation of any kind, and have already bought another 6 pack to try with a few friends!",FALSE ADVERTISING and INACCURATE INGREDIENT LIST,One person found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ve never ingested something that has made me feel so immediately bad for so long, other than food poisoning.  I gave it 3 tries.First was a late bday night (reason I got them to begin with) - felt nauseous that night but powered through, worst headache and hangover I can remember having in years the next day.  But, I did stay up really late so, hard to blame other factors for feeling bad, have it benefit of the doubt.2nd - didn’t stay up late, didn’t drink near as much - immediate nausea and headache.  Maybe I just had a bad mix of drink or food...3rd - ok lets see once and for all if this drink is the culprit.  This one was the most regretful.  Had 1 glass of wine with dinner...plus a glass of water.  No way I wouldn’t feel perfectly fine in normal circumstances. Took the drink.  Up all night fighting the feeling of vomiting, almost did a handful of times, I probably should have.  Bad headache ensued.  This was last night, I still feel like death this morning...it’s in fact GIVEN me a hangover (but, with more nausea ) that I otherwise wouldn’t have had.  I may even have to call into work, can’t believe how awful it’s made me feel.The rest of the bottles went straight into the trash where they belong.Drink at your own risk.","3 attempts,  feels slightly better than food poisoning.",One person found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars

I thought I had received a used product and found that this item is not returnable, plus the seller never responder to my inquiry.

I do like to on occasion drink to much. I have found that these things really work. I have tried them twice and both times was amazed.  I drank half a bottle of rum and a few beers last night. I took this when I was done drinking. I would normally have a horrible hangover with that much drinking. I woke up today with no hangover whatsoever. These things are worth every penny.

"So I was having a Sunday Funday with the guys yesterday at a crab feast that turned into bar hopping... Over the course of about 8 hours I had racked up quite a few drinks and was pretty drunk. When I got home, my wife handed me one of these bottles... I get some gnarly hangovers... the kind where all you do is hug the toilet and want to die the next day... especially with the amount I had just drank. But Sunday Funday right?Anyway, I drank it and I woke up this morning feeling more or less fine... I still experienced some grogginess and was a bit tired, but I at least I made it to work on time! No migraine/headache. No repetitive vomiting. I was able to eat breakfast! Sunday Funday's are back in the books for me! Only 4 stars though... because the flavor kind of tastes like watered down lemonade with a weird tangy aftertaste??? I imagined it would taste more like a 5 hour energy. Not a deal breaker though because I would rather take a shot of watery lemonade while drunk, than be calling in sick to work.... and be wrapped around the toilet all day today.

Works great! It taste like theraflu lemon if you ever had one of those teas then you know the flavor. I tried drinking one while drinking and it made me throw up a little the next morning but after that I didn’t have a hangover...then some other time I drank one after I was done drinking and I didn’t feel a thing the next day!

"This doesn’t work as well as MORNING CARE RECOVERY drink, that one has natural ingredients and is designed to help ease your liver while drinking or thereafter. I’ve tried the pills and this and it doesn’t work’- but @Drinkwithcare does, I am a mom of two children with a full time job and used to drink occasionally because of the turnaround time of how hungover I would be after a night out with my husband or family and friends. Now I can actually not worry about that and drink with ease and it painless.

"Used this product for the first time last night and woke up this morning with no hangover effects at all. Wife and I had dinner plans at 6:30 so I started with a pre-game double vodka Red Bull before we left.  During dinner we had a bottle of wine, and then came back home to finish a second bottle of wine.  If you divide it out, that’s a bottle of wine for me and the double vodka.  Took Morning Recovery right before bed at 11 pm. Taste left a lot to be desired. Advertised as lemon lime but doesn’t taste like that at all. Tastes more like bad medicine you had as a kid. Woke up at 7 am with absolutely no effects I had alcohol last night.  I would normally have a pretty good headache and not have my bearings straight, but not this morning. I was ready to get the day started. Definitely taking this on our trips to Cabo and Vegas next month. I’m a believer.",Works As Advertised,One person found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars

Truly, this stuff exceeded all expectations and every new version just gets better. Been using Morning Recovery since it first came out for those rare nights where the train gets rolling and just can't be stopped. Hangovers just aren't an option any more as a (somewhat) responsible adult. Thanks to the little magic genie and super nerd developed laboratory voodoo they put in each one of these little bottles, I haven't had a hangover for over two years.
