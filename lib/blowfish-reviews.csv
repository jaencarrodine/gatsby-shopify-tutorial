I don't consider myself an alcoholic. I would say I drink about once a month but when I do drink I drink. I pound back Jager until I end up in some strangers bed room dressed like a drag queen. After taking the walk of shame I throw some blowfish in a red solo cup head to work and this product makes it seem like the night prior was just a bad dream.

"I love this stuff!  The Hubby and I went to St. Lucia and enjoyed an all inclusive resort a little too much!

"I purchased this after reading lots of reviews and recommendations. I am extremely sensitive to alcohol, but enjoy the occasional cocktail and glass of wine, so decided to try Blowfish. After taking it the morning after drinking, a felt the initial rush from the caffeine and a few hours later the hangover set in. Having purchased multiple products for hangover prevention, I can say Detoxx for Hangovers worked best but only if taken with a full glass of water prior to drinking.",Literally ONLY aspirin and caffeine - and it doesn't work,86 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars

"As I get older I've been starting to get terrible hangovers after a night out. When my husband and I were going away to Vegas for a few days, I knew we wanted to make the most of our trip and not be stuck in bed with headaches and nausea. I decided to try these tablets given the positive reviews - and honestly, I was willing to try anything to not mess up our adults only trip! We went four days in Vegas with a lot of drinking, less than healthy eating, staying up way too late. We each added one of these tablets to our water bottle first thing in the morning and slowly sipped while getting up and around for the day. I never had a headache or nausea on this trip and the Blowfish tablets seemed to help give me a boost of energy that I needed to go another long day. I'd buy again!",4 days in Vegas with no hangover!,37 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars

"THE BEST PRODUCT EVER! I discovered blowfish a few years ago when I was sent it from a company called Influenster to review for my blog. I was realling from a product that was taken off of the market that was geared towards hangovers, so trying out blowfish was a welcomed surprise. All I can say is that I never leave home without them. I don’t travel without them. I for sure don’t drink without them. I loved them so much that I added them into 150 party favor boxes I recently did for a client. If you truly want to save the day, definitely get blowfish for hangovers! You won’t be disappointed!",If you don’t buy Blowfish you’re CRAZY!!!,31 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was told about this product and how well it worked.  I ordered it after reading a few of the reviews.  When it arrived, I happened to look at the ingredients.  I was shocked to see it is a simple aspirin product.  Each dose of Blowfish delivers 500 mg of aspirin and 60 mg of caffeine.  The second photo (white label) are the ingredients of BC powder.  Each dose delivers 845 mg of aspirin and 65 mg of caffeine.  12 dollars for twelve doses.  Gotta hand it to them, they made money off of this marketing strategy.  Sooooooooo, save your money and go buy some aspirin or alka seltzer.  For those of you that claim this is the most awesomest hangover cure EVER, well....  There's this thing called the placebo effect...",I only blame myself...,16 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I should have just sacked up and went to work without it. Seriously don’t take this on an empty stomach! It is basically like taking 1000 mg of aspirin and a few caffeine pills. I threw it out.

Seriously, why are you doing this to yourself!?!","More like Blowchunks, eh!?!",10 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I've tried lots of hangover remedies in the past. This one is by far the most overrated out of all of them. Essentially, these are fizz tablets that equate to a cup of coffee and two aspirins but it taste like lemon instead of coffee. What I find odd is that they went through the trouble of making this diuretic taste like a sports drink but didn't think to include any electrolytes or vitamins, which are proven to help a dehydrated person become rehydrated, seeing how that's one of the major reasons why people suffer hangovers in the first place.Also, aspirin is brutal on the stomach. Kind of odd to think that ingesting something that will make your stomach feel worse than it does already is somehow going to make it feel better.In the end, I give blowfish 2 stars instead of one. It did take my headache away, but it also made me a barely able to function bag of stomach pain and misery instead of the ""guaranteed"" hangover free human being.",Save your money.,7 people found this helpful,2.0 out of 5 stars
Garbage. Should have read what I was buying before assuming they accepted returns. I was looking at all the different hangover remedies and this one was amazon choice so I immediately gravitated towards it. Big mistake. It’s literally just asprin and caffeine. Both of which you can probably find in your own home already. No different than drinking coffee with an asprin.,There’s a reason there’s no return policy. They suckered you into buying it.,6 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this because I thought it might have some vitamins, supplements etc to help with a hangover.  But look at the photo.  I paid $6 for 100 of the Target generic pills.

"I subjected myself to some experiments for the sake of this review. This product worked better than pills and liquid drops I compared it to. I ordinarily get horrible hangovers if I drink more than one type of alcohol, even in small amounts, or anything too cheap or sugary. Even two glasses of nice wine will leave me feeling crappy the day after. I've always been the one who drinks less than my friends and is stuck in bed the next day while everyone else is fine. The first time I was given this it was a night after drinking wine and other mixed drinks. I normally would have been in bed all day. Literally within two hours of taking it I had eaten, showered, and was out on a boat not feeling sick. When I experimented with it, I tried taking one tablet before I went to bed after drinking and one the next day and that worked really well. These have caffeine though, so be wary of taking them at night. I don't drink a lot of caffeine but I feel only the mildest caffeine feeling from taking them. I tried taking one when I hadn't drank and had no hangover, and it did give me a little pick me up. Slight increase in energy and stomach felt great. So you could use these when you were generally feeling under the weather. I try to just avoid drinking anything or any quantity that would make me sick, but I like having these on hand now so I don't have to suffer if I do. Highly recommend.",Best hangover product I've tried,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I just tried this product after hearing some good feedback from a friend.  Blowfish does not disappoint.  It cured my queasiness and headache and I was able to turn a couple questionable mornings into productive work days.  I also felt a little energy burst.  Unlike a lot of hangover cures, you don't have to take this before you drink.  Just pop a tab in some water when you wake up feeling not so great - so no preplanning required.  I will definitely keep these around in the future.",A+ Product,17 people found this helpful,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've tried the tablets twice. The first time I took two, and it made me more nauseous than I already was. It also gave me the shakes and a very rappid heartrate. I was worried something was seriously wrong. I decided to give it another try with just half a pack. Still the same shaky nauseous feeling. Please do not use this product. Just drink water and take Ibuprofen.",Read before you buy. Scary heartrate.,9 people found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
I've used several different hang over remedies and have found this one to be one of the best for taking if I'm feeling symptoms.  There are some remedies that you can take prior to imbibing that can provide some relief as well.  I typically take a box of this when I'm traveling and know that I might be drinking but don't want to have a potential hangover can can interfere with my plans.For me it's a must have item when traveling.  It even works if I have a moderate headache in general in a pinch if I don't have Tylenol.,Works Well,One person found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This is the only hangover product I use anymore.  There are plenty of ""prevention"" products that help a little bit but this is the only thing that will actually get rid of your hangover.  I wake up hungover, make one of these, chug half and then sleep for another 15-20 min and by the time I wake up my hangover is nearly gone and I drink the rest.  It tastes great and isn't something you struggle to choke down in the morning.  I can't say enough good things about this product.  I have it on subscribe and save and don't think I'll ever take it off.  I hand these out to my friends on a night of drinking and they love it for the morning too.",10 stars,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have been a user of Blowfish for years. We were on vacation in Mexico with some friends. After an evening of revelry, and a  successful early start to day drinking, my bud got that far off look in his eye, started slurring and promptly needed to go lay down. Though we lost him for the rest of the evening, but fortunately I had the secret weapon packed with me. Sent his wife back to the room with some Blowfish and about an hour later he was back in action with Tecate in hand 👍For hangovers specifically after taking it, in about 30 min you start to get back on the path to normal.

"I honestly do not know how I ever lived without Blowfish before. As I come upon my 30's and continue to push my liver into alcohol induced overdrive, my hangovers are starting to push back... aggressively.  This stuff is a miracle cure. You get hangover headaches? Check. You get hangover nausea? Check. You get hangover fatigue? Check. You get a gnarly case of the D.A.D.S.? Check.  It covers all the bases. Its Alka Seltzer on steroids with a slightly chemically taste but in no way disgusting. And also blessedly not fruit flavored for any of my cocktail drinking friends out there who can't possibly stomach the idea of fruit flavored medicine after a night of vodka cranberry/pineapple/orange etc...

"I’ve almost tried this product once.  I had a fun day on the lake, went to a concert, and had to ride in a car home the next day.  Wasn’t feeling well.  Broke these tablets and dropped them in a bottle of water.  Now I will say I was to the point of extreme “got ran over by a train”.  My first big drink of blowfish was absolutely so disgusting, it almost made me even more sick. I tried another drink and had to spit it out.  One final third chug of this and I threw it as far as I could.  Felt pretty rough all the way up until I got some Wendy’s and Hi-C to drink with a little snooze.  Maybe this works if you can get it down, I could not.  Trying “Cheers” next time.",🤢🤮🤢,One person found this helpful,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought for a bachelor party weekend. I think they worked alright. My only issue is that it’s really just excedrin extra strength disguised as lemon alka-seltzer. Which is how Its “FDA” approved for hangovers.Did it work. Probably. Is it more than novelty branding. No way.  As a matter of convenience it’s cool and it tasted alright. But as far as value you goes. You can get a bottle of water and a 24 pill bottle of excedrin for about the same price. Didn’t hate it, just wish it had more added benefit like vitamins and all that, rather than just dissolvable lemon flavored aspirin and caffeine. I should have read the package better before I bought it. Def bought into the hangover cure branding.",It’s dissolvable lemon flavored excedrin extra strength.,no rating,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This is honestly the worst product for hangovers in my experience. I took it according to the directions and all it did was make me dizzy and more drunk. I’m presuming it’s the caffeine but would strongly encourage you to not use this product. I unfortunately waited to use it until after the return window and I’m now stuck with two boxes of useless product. Will never be using or purchasing again. It really did make me feel worse all day, all I could do was chug water after water hoping my system would clear it. Bottom line would not recommend especially if caffeine might be a problem.

"This is the absolute best product for a hangover. I went to a 4 day wedding in Mexico that was fueled with tequila, unmentionables  and bad decisions.

"As a mom and in my 30s as the drinks keep pouring I often forget my age and what’s waiting for me what I wake up after a night out. Honestly I am the worst with hang overs I am down for the count and cannot rally, but blowfish is LIFE and every time I have taken it ( have Purchased 4x now for my husband and i) we both are shocked at the lack of hangover.

"I've found more uses for this than just after too much fun the night before. It works great for that, don't get me wrong, but I also find it great for general soreness and body aches in the morning. I find that it's also a great way to get a big glass of water down in the morning as well, good way to start the day. It tastes good and gets the job done.

"Before I discovered Blowfish for Hangovers, I was a mere child drinking only on weekends. ""ROOKIE"", ""NOOB"" are just a few of the things the Boys would yell at me. The humiliation I felt was too much to bear, I needed to find a way out.Night after night, Google search after Google search left me feeling hopeless, was there no cure?!Then one night, defeated from 2 Smirnoff Ice's, I lay there helpless in bed.

But this was no ordinary ad my fellow readers, it was the cure!Since incorporating Blowfish for Hangovers into my diet, gone are the days of name calling and low calorie beer drinking.

"I bought this as I've noticed that my hangovers tend to last for days now instead of hours like they used to back when I was in my 20's.  Also another reason why I don't really drink like I did in my 20's.  I figured what the hell.  I was incredibly surprised by how quickly I felt better.  I seemed to function as an adult again within a few hours of taking it and wasn't a total lazy SOB on the couch (which is normal for my hangovers).  I've told many friends about this product and would recommend it to anyone.  Not sure why I'm going with 4 stars out of 5, no real reason to it, if there was a 4.5 star option, I'd go with that.  Maybe if I had multiple hangovers since buying the product, it would provide further background to justify the extra star, but I'm not willing to subject myself to multiple hangovers in quick succession anymore.  Now I just hope it doesn't expire anytime soon (just checked, it doesn't expire).","Great to Have, Just in Case",4 people found this helpful,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Easier on the stomach the next day to get down a painkiller if you have vomiting problems like me the next day after night out. I have pretty severe hangovers no matter how much or little I drink and have a hard time keeping anything down the next day. I would have days were I couldnt keep any sort of food or medicine in my stomach for long enough to take effect and help my body. (no judgement please, Im just getting old lol) But this was easier to quickly drink down and get into my system to take away the headache and body ache. The bubbles from the effervescent felt actually really good in my stomach and helped with some of the indigestion I experience. I wasnt a huge fan of the caffeine as I get post-drinking anxiety where your body goes through alcohol withdrawals, but it def helped get the painkiller into my bloodstream faster.

For some stupid reason Alka-Seltzer discontinued it, and I was IRATE!  I'm so glad Blowfish was created, because for whatever reason this combination of aspirin and caffeine in liquid form works magic for my hangovers.  My biggest issue is the headache, and this product rids me of the headache portion of my hangover usually within 30 minutes.Note:  This product does NOT rid you of all hangover symptoms, such as the cloudiness and clumsiness.  I'm not sure about helping with nausea since I don't usually get nauseous, but it may help with that too.  However, people who are nauseous the next day might have a hard time swallowing 8-10 oz of fizzy water, so keep that in mind.

"One of my friends give me a packet of Blowfish after a night out- and I loved it.  It reminds me of alia-seltzer but is more effective against the symptoms of hangover.  Blowfish soothed my stomach, got rid of my headache, and made me feel like a human being again.I have friends who have elaborate hangover cures- usually disgusting rituals- blowfish works wonders just by adding the tablets to a glass of water.  I have purchased other products claiming to be a hangover cure- but this one is the best that I have found in the United States.The biggest testament to the effectives and merit of the product is that I have come back to buy it again and again.  It is not a cheap product- but it works wonders and is all worth the reasonable price. Also this product is also sold at your local pharmacies- but when I last ran out and had not re-supplied, I stopped by two pharmacies in my town who claim they have it but could not find it on their shelves.  Plan ahead, and keep a supply in your medicine cabinet.I am reviewing this product in an effort to help other Amazon customers through relaying my experience with the product and providing any insight I garnered.

"Bfish or Blow, as it's often referred to on the street, is the greatest thing ever invented second only to Chick Fil A. While sailing the calm seas on a cruise vessel recently, my buddy and I caught our selves in a bit of a pickle. We had both taken 10 shots in the span of about 45 minutes. Even though this isn't uncommon practice at most bachelor parties, our tenacious and overzealous spirit came at a cost. We began to lose all motor skills rather quickly. Our only hope of survival that night was to puke, Bfish, reset and rally and that's exactly what we did. Within an hour of losing our motor skills and Bfishing we were back in action and not a minute late. I've never recovered so quickly. This product deserves Five starts across the board.

This stuff is legit. It's gotten me through hangovers when I went out on weekday benders and had to go to work the next day and even a 3-day music festival. There's nothing these tv-static flavored tablets can't do. 10/10 and gonna buy again and again,TV static flavored miracle tablets,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars

This seems to work quickly and doesn’t taste too bad. The key is to not put it in a lot of water so you can just take 3-4 big drinks of it. It definitely helped kick me into gear on my bachelorette party.,Quick fix,no rating,4.0 out of 5 stars
Not absolutely sure if it worked bc I used along with other products but I felt good so I guess it at least helped.,Good product,no rating,5.0 out of 5 stars
